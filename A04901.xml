            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reate haue beene thoſe harmes (right honorable and my very good Lord) which the Church of God in euery age hath ſuffred at the hands of ſtraungers &amp; open enemies vnto the trueth: but yet nothing ſo grieuous, as that hurte which ſhe hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time had at home, by ſome who haue long layen in her owne boſome, and as Children beene ſerued from her owne table. For, as ciuill warre is alwayes more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then foraine force: So the enemyes within the church, be they who of al other deale with greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt the Church.

who are no ſworne enemyes vnto Religion (if matters be not very wiſely &amp; with great iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t examined) to ouermatch vs. For the continuance of friendſhip as they pretend vnto Religion, ſeemeth to aſſure vs that their profiting in knowledge and iudgement, and no other cauſe, hath moued them aſwell to be diuers from them ſelues, as to departe from vs. As for the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemie, he is more hardened againſt our cauſe and better armed againſt our ſelues, when he ſeeth the cauſe it ſelfe as it were parted by opinion, and vs deuided from our ſelues in affection. Theſe enemyes of the Church do both ſtrengthen the enemies arme abrode, and alſo diſcourage the friendes at home, yet hath the true Church alwayes beene ſubiect to this tryal, euen when Doctrine was moſte pure and paſtors moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.<note place="margin">2.

               <hi>There muſte bee hereſies</hi> (ſayeth Saint Paule) <hi>euen among you, that they which are proued among you may be knowne.</hi> The cauſes why it muſt be thus with the Church, doe I finde in the ſcripture to be theſe: that the good may bee tried and knowne: &amp; the wicked fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out &amp; puniſhed. The good are tried whether they loue the Lord, aſwel by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towarde the doctrine of Chriſte,<note place="margin">Deu. 13.3.</note> as by their fruits of conuerſation. For there is no man that loueth
<pb facs="tcp:8542:3"/>
an other, who is not ſtudious of his diſpoſition, to knowe what is well liked of him and acceptable vnto him, that he may ſerue his humour and be ſet a woorke to his good liking and pleaſure. So that hee who hath beſtowed no ſtudy that way, either is not otherwiſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in iudgement or moued with affection, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeducer may deceiue him: doeth plainely declare therein that he beareth no loue towards him.</p>
            <p>Puniſhment is executed againſt the wicked, either by giuing them vp into hereſies and erronious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for that hauinge the trueth in knowledge, they made no conſcience of it, neither in affection did beare any loue towarde it: either elſe becauſe not ſubmitting them ſelues to the ſimplicitie of the word, they haue deſired to be fed with curious queſtions, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of witte and ſubtile ſpeculations. Of both thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, we are not onely warned off by the doctrine of the woorde,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 1.19.20. 2. Tim. 2.16.17.</note> but alſo by the heauy iudgement of God which did fall vpon certaine offenders herein, whereof there is expreſſe mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made in the word. Great is the groſſenes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Papiſts, who therfore ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the true church, becauſe ſome proue heretiques that haue beene brought vp in the boſome therof, as if they had neuer red this in the Scripture ſpoken in the perſon of the Church, <hi>They went out from vs,</hi>

               <hi>but they were not of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they woulde haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with vs:</hi> but greater is the careleſſeneſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that would be accounted Chriſtians, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe heauie examples and viſible warnings of Gods wrath, bee not touched for all that with care to ioyne conſcience vnto knowledge, and to let a good iudgement haue the honour of a louing affection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes waiting vpon it.</p>
            <p>May profeſſors of the trueth now poſſibly bee any longer ſatiſfied with bare profeſſion, when the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:8542:4"/>
hath alredy take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reuengme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof into his own hands, &amp; begun to driue ſuch out of their dennes, &amp; to hunt them out of their lurking holes, and not to leaue them before hee haue brought their deſerued iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of palpable blindeneſſe vpon them: ſo that we ſe them before our eyes, glory in their ſhame, and put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as a garment of honour the couering of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: therefore the puniſhment of God fallen now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly vpon this family, is the iudgement of bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and carnal Goſpellers. In theſe perſons they al are arrained, found giltie &amp; iudged. Now haue we learned by tryall &amp; experience, that the Goſpel diſdaineth the ſole attendance of our knowledge, and looketh to bee receiued in like manner with a good heart and friendly affection. And good cauſe and reaſon there is why it ſhould be ſo, for who is ſo meane amongſt men, that would be content with this entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amongſt his friendes, if at his comming to them they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to name him, and take knowledge that they had ſeene him. And is not this the beſt welcome that many in theſe dayes doe make the Goſpel? they are content to ſpeake to it, &amp; take knowledge of it, but they are but a few, that ſo friendly do entertaine it, as that their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie goodwil &amp; affection may be ſeene to appeare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by towards it. This iudgement of God vpon <hi>H.N.</hi> and his Family, ſpeaketh plainly of the Goſpel, that we can not enioy it, if wee giue no better entertainment then they haue done vnto it. For as for them, they are now farther from the knowledge of the Goſpel, then they were the firſt houre that euer they looked vppon the light. For Chriſt is nothing with them but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto that doctrine which they profeſſe. Which may eaſily be diſcerned by <hi>H.N.</hi> his diſcription of him, which is this: <hi>Chriſtus</hi> doth ſignifie vnto vs (ſaith <hi>H.N.</hi>) the ſafe making oyle of the God ſauing being: and yet more plainely is that matter expreſſed in the Booke en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tituled

The onely way whereby a man ſhould enter to do them good, haue they hedged and ſtopped vp againſt vs, for they ſay that they onely are ſpirituall, and therefore iudge truely of the word, that they haue the ſence, and we nothing but the words: they haue the ſpirit, and we nothing but the letter: that they haue the life, and we the body: they haue the carnel, &amp; we the ſhell: they haue the ſword, and we the ſcabbard. To be briefe in this matter of doctrine, <hi>H.N.</hi> turneth religion vp ſide downe, and buildeth heauen heere vpon earth, maketh God, man: and man, God: heauen, hell: &amp; hel heauen, For venom and poyſon which will bring preſent death, hath he diſperſed ouer euery member &amp; article of our beliefe, ſo vniuerſall is the poyſon of his opinion.</p>
            <p>Touching conuerſation, howe may wee imagine that there is any ſoundneſſe, when the doctrine and vitall partes be thus infected. For do we not read in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that moſt ſhameful corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life hath alwaies followed as a due &amp; deſerued puniſhment, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doctrine.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note>

For if temptations preſſe vs, and our prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently preuaile not, by this doctrine we are diſcharged of all daunger from the fact, howe often and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly ſoeuer we ſhall offende. Whom would not this doctrine, not onely incourage vnto ſinne: but alſo make him impudently ſecure, and ſenſeleſſe in the ſame. This monſtrous birth ſo beaſtly and ſo blinde hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of the worde and want of care to keepe it in a good conſcience, nouriſhed and brought forth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ſee with what daunger we walke not onely wickedly, but alſo careleſly againſt the worde. For this ſpectacle doeth plainly ſhew, that it is more precious in the Lord his ſight, then that he either can or will put vp at our hands, the contempt and neglect of the ſame. And therfore when we ſee at this day, thoſe men who
<pb facs="tcp:8542:6"/>
ſometimes haue knowne the trueth, become as beaſtes voyde of all reaſon: let vs vnderſtande that the Lorde thereby meaneth to magnifie his worde, and to let men perceiue the might and Maieſtie of the ſame. For when he cannot abide that they ſhould anie longer enioy ſo much credite by his word, as the ſhew &amp; bare profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would yeeld vnto them, which is al that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that he wil haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turned out of their clouts and laid naked in their ſhame: doth he not from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſuch iudgements preach &amp; declare the maieſtie and might of his word? Is not that the great ſeale ſent from heauen into the earth, to be ſet vnto the worde for the authorizing thereof? For ſeeing they would not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it brought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the Lords owne hand and ſeale of ſignes &amp; miracles: they haue forced him by bringing theſe heauie iudgements vppon them for the further confirming of it, to ſet his ſeale the ſecond time vnto it. Should not all men nowe feare to prophane it, when there is here among vs a mark of ſuch maieſtie ſet vpon it? Should not euerie man now examine what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerence he doth beare vnto it, when he ſeeth for the freeing of it from contempt ſo great &amp; plaine a print of authoritie to be ioyned vnto it? Let people now take heed how they cheriſh that humor within themſelues, which cannot beare any other teaching of the woord, then that which is ſo interteyned of the eare, that it can not bee hired ſo much as once to vewe and viſite the heart. Let thoſe feare who cannot digeſt the word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe with eloquence and wit, curious queſtions, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane hyſtories and fables, the power and ſtrenght of it bee ſo allayed, as nowe there is no more any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in it. And ſeeing we haue ſuch ſenſible iudgement among vs againſt them, who like not the ſimplicitie of the worde, but will feed of ſpeculations and myſticall matters: let them who miniſter the worde, take heede
<pb facs="tcp:8542:6"/>
they feede not that affection in them, by laying on ſuch painting and colours, as may rather make them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the workemanſhip, then take any profite by the worke. Let them teach and exhort with wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, not onely planting knowledge in them, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly calling vpon them to keepe their knowledge in a good conſcience, and ſo much the rather, becauſe wee ſee before our eyes, what a daungerous ſhipwracke they haue made euen of knowledge, who haue gone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea with it, in the riuen veſſell of a corrupt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Let them ſtyrre them vppe to haue their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a readineſſe, ſeeing the Lorde hath alreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne to viſite the contempt of his woorde. Let them vrge them likewiſe to ſeeke for iudgement in the word, whereby to diſcerne ſpirites, that ſeeing nowe we bee ſought and ſifted that way by Sathan, we may be found ſufficiently armed likewiſe on that ſide againſt him, leſt wilful ignorance ſhould bee puniſhed in vs with obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate errour. Let vs prouide that thoſe may be ioyned togither which the Lord cannot abide to put a ſunder: that zeale, for lacke of knowledge doe not degenerate either into ſome daungerous ſchiſme or ſuperſtition: neither yet knowledge for want of zeale &amp; affection, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into vnprofitable curioſity, or els into ſome horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereſie. Touching thoſe who be of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that theſe hereſies will vaniſh away of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſo groſſe, &amp; the men be ſo vtterly vnlearned, and therfore would neither haue ſword nor pen pulled out againſt them: They are to be required that they woulde vouchſafe to haue their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t waied by the word, ſo ſhould they find it lighter then the wind. For doth not the Apoſtle tell vs, that want of affection and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the truth, pulleth the eyes of our knowledge out of our heads, &amp; procureth belief &amp; credit vnto manifeſt lies &amp; vntruthes: inſomuch that where this iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god entreth, the greateſt vntruthes ſhal not be receiued waueringly
<pb facs="tcp:8542:7"/>
in opinion, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly in beliefe, &amp; ſtrong perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: now with what affection the goſpel is receiued of many among vs, whether with ſo good an affection as will warrant vs that way, I think in this behalfe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is much better then an euill defence. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the want of learning in the patrons of theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, who knoweth not, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith wrought more woe vnto the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> by hindering the courſe of the goſpel, then any either elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orator, or ſubtile Philoſopher. For when ſimple men ſuch as be artificers, thruſt forth themſelues with as much boldnes as blindneſſe, to be guides for others vnto God: forthwith that is fathered by the multitude vpon the miraculous &amp; extraordinarie worke of God: and therefore they will haue all of them, who haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined vnto knowledge by ordinarie meanes, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie yeelde and giue place to their better &amp; ſuperiour. My purpoſe was at the beginning to haue dealt onely with his booke intituled <hi>Euangelium Regni,</hi> but finding it ſtand often vpon one thing (as what order can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion affoord vnto vs?) I thought I ſhould better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the Reader, if I ſhould examine his iudgement vpon euerie ſeueral article of our beliefe, which he hath ſet downe in his firſt exhortation: and withall for the better vnderſtanding thereof ſhould cite theſe places out of his <hi>Euangelie,</hi> where hee handleth the ſame matter, and that ſo largely, as it may eaſily appeare vnto all men, that neither I haue miſſed of his meaning nor yet dealt vnfaythfully by ſuppreſsing any trueth in my allegations. Where he doth vſually peſter his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with plenty of authorities, as if nothing but ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might at any time be heard out of his mouth: It is a bayte layde for the ſimple, who either cannot or will not examen the matter. For falſhoode wil as wel guard the trueth, as thoſe authorities defend the cauſe he hath
<pb facs="tcp:8542:7"/>
in hande. I haue peruſed them one by one, which are alleaged to warrant his calling, where I am ſure hee bringeth foorth the beſt euidences that hee hath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it toucheth his freehold: let them be viewed, that is the treatiſe which I firſt deal withal, and as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, ſo let the reſt be beleued. Wherin vnleſſe I ſhould ouermuch abaſe <hi>H.N.</hi> I can no better match him then with S. George, as the papiſtes doe deſcribe him. For as S. George loueth to bee alwayes on horſbacke albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he neuer ride: So H.N. hath great liking to be mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the margent vpon the autorities of the ſacred worde, albeit they neuer ſtep forth with him, to ſpeake ſo much as one woorde for him. I haue added next vnto that before I enter to examine the articles of the beliefe, his iudgement of originall ſinne, taken out of the 5. Chapter of his Euangelie, becauſe thoſe only were the matters which that booke had more and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that doctrine which is handled in his expoſition vpon the Creede. His words be wrapped in ſuch dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obſcuritie as doe geue euident teſtimony of his minde that he meaneth to deceiue. As for the parts of his arguments, they be at ſuch variance with in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequens can by no right be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good abearing againſt his antecedent. For mark their meating, &amp; you ſhal perceiue that alwaies the one draweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, &amp; wil neuer leaue him before he haue either a leg or an arme of him. And in aſmuch as partly by his dark ſpeaking, &amp; partly by his allegorical expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he hath hatched a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he calleth Chriſt: I haue added to the end of this booke 3. ſeuerall ſhort treatiſes, of thoſe 3. ſpecial matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the booke with a Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I made hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moued therunto by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that the preſent occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did then force me to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hiſtorie of Chriſt his death, which <hi>H.N.</hi> would
<pb facs="tcp:8542:8"/>
wholy and altogither transforme into an allegorie: but alſo for that in ſo large a matter of doctrine to reforme our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I wiſhed there might be ſomwhat ioined to further our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation. I haue likewiſe ſet down the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome godly &amp; learned, as wel of the Dutch church as of our owne, touching theſe hereſies of <hi>H.N.</hi> that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues may ſee I am not alone, neither in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither in this neceſſarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe fruits of my labours my (very good Lord) I preſent vnto your honour as a publike teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my humble duetie &amp; good will vnto your L. not only in reſpect of my ſelfe for your L. great good deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings towarde me, but alſo in regarde of many others, who find a ſafe harborow vnder your honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and haue ſuch an eaſie acceſſe &amp; entrance vnto your honour, in all their good occaſions and lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: as bindeth vs vnto all duetie and thankfulneſſe vnto his maieſtie and your honor as his inſtrument for the ſame. Which hath made me bold at this time to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto your honourable care, the redreſſe of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enormity, which of late hath broken out in this land, I meane this Athiſme brought in by <hi>H.N.</hi> &amp; that his houſehold who will bee called the Familie of loue. The ſeruice your honour may doe vnto God in it; is great: the hope to preuaile againſt them in like maner is good: for as true Religion ſpreadeth and increaſeth vnder the croſſe, ſo puniſhment and affliction is the bane of hereſie and falſe religion. With what care and conſcience ſuch matters are to bee dealt withall, that which is read in Deut. 14. may ſufficiently direct your honour. Where it is plainly declared, that if anie ſhall ſecretly intice vnto a ſtrange religion, either friend, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or brother, (the neareſt bondes that nature or friendſhip hath) they ſtand charged not only to reueale it, but alſo that their handes ſhall be firſt vpon them, to
<pb facs="tcp:8542:8"/>
put them to death. To bewray the ſecretes of a deare friend, who is to a man as his owne ſoule, ſeemeth to fleſh and blood an heynous matter: to deale ſo with a mans brother the ſonne of his mother, or with his daughter the bowels of his owne bodie: the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doeth crie out of it: and yet for the glorie of our God, we are not onely in ſuch a caſe to reueale this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but our ſelues to be the chiefe doers in the death &amp; execution of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which telleth vs that with the true worſhip of God and religion, neither friendſhip nor nature may enter anie compariſon: nay it telleth vs that at the bringing in of Idolatry &amp; a ſtrange religion how ſecretly ſoeuer the ſeedes therof ſhal be ſowen, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the impunitie therof, Gods glorie ſhould be defaced, and the daunger that is due for the neglect thereof ſhould be ſuſteined: we are not onely to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide naturall affection, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to breake into our owne bowels, &amp; to bathe our ſelues in our owne blood. The caſe ſo nearly touching the glorie of our God, I am in good hope, that this which hath bene ſaid, ſhall ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perſwade your honour, to enter into ſome ſpeedie care &amp; conſideration, how to ſuppreſſe ſo great &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a danger. Your L. labour in this cauſe ſo directly and ſo daungerouſly dealing againſt the higheſt, hee can neuer forget to recompence: who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reward, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a cup of cold water beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leaſt of thoſe little ones, who doe beleeue in his name The God of all glorie make you partaker of that honour, which is aſſured vnto all them, who by theſe &amp; ſuch like fruites of faith, ſhall trauaile the ratifying of their owne election, and the remouing of all ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or blemiſhes, which either hurt the health, or hinder the beautie of the Church.</p>

Theſ. 2.10.</note> ſheweth that the Lorde woulde ſet vp that renna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſeat, as it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner or ſergeant of his wrathfull iudgement, againſt thoſe which ſhould not haue the loue of the trueth: that they which would not effectually beleeue it, receiuing ſentence of the Lord himſelf to beleeue lies effectually, ſhoulde be put to the execution thereof by the miniſterie of that ſeat. The truth wherof as in other places of Europe, ſo in this our Countrey eſpecially, is euidently ſeene: where the Lord ſitting in his Aſsiſe not twiſe a yeare, but all the whole yeare long, reuengeth the ſhameful contempt and neglect of his truth: by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding numbers to their ſtie or walter againe, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne into the fouldes of Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpell, behaued themſelues coldly and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein. And albeit in long proceſſe of time, this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker of Poperie, be able to eat vp the whole church: yet the ſinnes of our Countrey crie ſo loude, that is to ſay are done ſo openly and ſo vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolledly in the ſight of the Lord, that as if he woulde make a ſhort hande of all, he ſetteth vpon vs with diuerſe engines, at once to pull downe that which he hath ſo graciouſly builded, and with diuerſe axes layde euen to the roote, vtterly to cutte vp that which his owne hand hath planted.</p>
            <p>And to follow the former compariſon, as where there are great ſtore of fellons, the Iuſtices of Aſsiſe, are faine to ſeuer and ſingle themſelues, to make the
<pb facs="tcp:8542:11"/>
ſpeedier hande of them: euen ſo through heapes of thoſe which haue no loue of the truth in them, the lord is as it were faine to erect vp other iudgement ſeates, by the which hee may eaſe himſelfe of them: and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point other hangmen, for their quicker diſpatch to the place wherevnto they are adiudged. And therefore contenteth not himſelf now with the hereſie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, which haue beene a long time the principall ſincke to receiue the outcaſtes of the Church, nor with the hereſie of the Arians and Anabaptiſts, as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſes of office, whereunto ſome of the filth of the Church hath beene diſcharged: but ſtirreth vp other brandes of hell, to ſet fire as it were in euerie corner of the Church. Of this ſort are the vnlouely companie of them that call themſelues the Familie of loue.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon it may be vnderſtanded howe vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Goſpel is charged, as that which is in ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God: becauſe in the time of the preaching thereof, there riſe ſuch damnable ſectes, and that from them, which haue borne the name of Goſpellers. Wherein the Goſpel needeth ſo little to feare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion hereof: that the ſame tendeth euen to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of the great price and eſtimation, that the Lorde hath it in. For as the great eſtimation of the lawes of the lande, is taken from the ſeuere puniſhment practiſed againſt the deſpiſers of them: ſo theſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements executed vpon them, which in their mouthes vaunting the Goſpel, in their workes denied the vertue of the ſame, are preachers of the great ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which the Lord hath ouer the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Which alſo becauſe he woulde not haue ſlaundered with the filth of ſuch ſectes, he ſo ordereth the matter: that where our Church hath no ſtrength to throw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, they ſhould willingly caſt out the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: therby to receiue their ſhame vpon their owne heades, &amp; to cleare
<pb facs="tcp:8542:11"/>
the Goſpel with all reaſonable men, of that ſlaunder which ſome would gladly faſten vpon it. For if holding their monſtrous opinions, they had notwithſtanding remained in the boſome of the Church: although falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet colourably it might haue bene ſaid, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel fauoureth ſuch misſhapen &amp; deformed things. But when as the Lord, in care to vphold the good report of the Goſpel, hath caſt them out, and they in a conſcience of the hatred that the Goſpelling Churches beare vnto ſuch frenſies, haue ſundered themſelues from them: it is maruaile that there can be anie ſo blind as not to ſee, or ſo impudent as not to confeſſe, that neither the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is the mother, nor the Churches thereof the nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie of any ſuch helliſh opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not therefore the loue of the Goſpel profeſſed of vs, but the want of loue, not the profeſsion but the fruitleſſe profeſsion: that is cauſe of theſe confuſions.</p>
            <p>Whereof there is yet more clearer proofe, in that as the rout of theſe heretiks, looked for the enmitie of our Churches: ſo haue they felt their hand more ſore vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the hand of any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany in the world: yea our Churches litle finger hath weyed heauier vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the loines of all other aſſemblies whatſoeuer. The Papiſts prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d great enmitie to the Anabaptiſts, Swink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldians, Arians, &amp; other ſuch deteſtable <hi>Antitrinitaries:</hi> yet for twentie of our fields fought againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are not able to ſhew two: for a hundreth ſtrokes giuen by vs, they are ſcarce able to ſhew one giuen by them: that is to ſay, they are ſcarce able to ſhew a line for a leafe, or a leaf for a booke. And euen in this Apoſtume of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of loue doubt you nothing, but the Papiſts make ſhew of ſuch a hatred, as cannot be outmatched. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit it if you loke either to the cauſe, or the effect of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, you ſhall ſee their viſard eaſily pulled of. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cauſe, it ſhal plainly appere by the diſcourſe of
<pb facs="tcp:8542:12"/>
their opinions: that the Papiſtes hauing moe thinges in common with them then wee haue, haue leſſe cauſe of hatred then we. And for the effect, let them ſhewe where anie of the Iuſtices leaning to Poperie, haue ſo carefully and painefully dealt for the ſuppreſsing of them: as haue the Iuſtices which fauour the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Or let them ſhewe, where anie of their Popiſhe Cleargie, hath laboured for the ouerthrowe of their Hereſies: as haue the Miniſters of the Goſpel. I meane not to charge their Cleargie for not ſpeaking, where their ſilence is ſo iuſt: but yet for not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, howe can they deliuer themſelues, conſidering their leyſure which they both haue a hundreth folde more then our Miniſters, and which they can vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But as in this effect of our hatred againſt hereſies, we haue in Chriſt Ieſus a godly triumph, in reſpect of the Papiſtes: ſo for the want of that care which ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in vs, aſwel for the preuenting of ſuch miſchiefs before they fal, as for the remouing of them when they are fallen: we, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we all haue great cauſe to hang down our heads. For albeit the lord in his moſt iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for reuenge of the contempt of the Goſpel, hath giuen vp theſe miſerable men to their owne fantaſies: yet is it alſo' certaine that our incircumſpection hath had a mighty ſtroke, to the bringing of it to paſſe. For firſt the gates of the Citie of God with vs, lie ſo wide open to all that will enter in: as if wee might looke for that ſecuritie here vppon earth, that both doores and barres, lockes and keyes ſhoulde bee needeleſſe. For if anie will enter into our Churches, who almoſte is there, to aske him from whence hee came: to inſtruct him of the lawes of the Citie: to require publike, both confeſsion of his former infidelitie, and profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſounder fayth? Secondly, if being thus raſhly
<pb facs="tcp:8542:12"/>
admitted, there were yet ſome wall or raile to holde them in, vntill ſuch time as they might bee better taught: The careleſſe receiuing of them, might haue beene ſomewhat recompenced by a narrowe watche and warde, that they ſhoulde not iſſue out againe. But both the gates of our entring in, and going out, being thus vnkept: there groweth vnto the Church an infamous ſlaunder, whileſt they are all iudged to haue beene of our Religion, the greateſt number whereof haue beene ſuch babes therein, as they knewe not the difference betwene their right and left hand. So that the bare name of Goſpellers excepted, which they gat by treading now and then vpon the pauement of our aſſemblies: they ſtill remained in the ſame ignoraunce of the truth, wherein they were at firſt. Where againe it appeareth, howe vniuſtly the Goſpell is charged with theſe fallings away, which it woulde haue ſtayed, if it might haue had the full courſe: as is to be ſeene in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, where the ſame Goſpell being receiued, ſuch offences ſo thicke and threefold haue not enſued. For this happineſſe, that no offences at all ſhould bee: happened not vnto the Churches gouerned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelues.</p>
            <p>This then being a great peece of our fault, for that we met not with theſe miſchiefs aforehand: another peece is, that due care hath not bene taken, for the aboliſhing of them, after they were entred in vpon vs. Wherevnto albeit (as is aforeſayd) diuerſe godly, both Magiſtrates and Miniſters haue put to their hand: yet as in a houſe ſet on fire, all runne to the quenching of it, ſo it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that to the ſuppreſsing of this fire, comming forth of the bottomleſſe pit of hell, all ioyntly ſhoulde haue giuen their attendance, and euerie one haue drawne a bucket of thoſe waters,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.15.</note> which the Iſraelites did in their calamitie. For I meane not, that they ſhoulde haue met
<pb facs="tcp:8542:13"/>
to deale with the familie of loue: but with the Lorde our God. Who as in his iuſt wrath, hee hath raiſed vp this curſed ſect: ſo vnleſſe the ſame bee firſt appeaſed, in humbling our ſelues before him in prayer with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and faſting, our eyes may faint in our heades with looking for remedie either of this euill or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hang ouer vs.</p>
            <p>But I ſee well enough what the cauſe is: why in ſo great an ouerplus of cares for other things, there is yet ſo ſmall care taken of this, and it is, becauſe it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed perillous vnto the eſtate. So (by the way) is the glorie of God troden vnder our feete, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be defaced: yet ſo that it be imagined (for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be) without hazard of the eſtate, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none that layeth it to his heart. But yet tell mee (I pray you) howe come we to be ſo ſecure of the eſtate againſt this route of heretikes. For let it not hurt the eſtate, that it is the peſtilenteſt hereſie that euer was in the land, that it leaueth neuer a peece of the knowledge of GOD whole and vnſhaken, that it is a maſſe or packe of Poperie, Arianiſme, Anabaptiſme, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiſme: I ſay let all this not once touch the foote of the eſtate, which notwithſtanding preaſeth to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie throate of it: yet that it maketh no conſcience of anie duetie to men, their owne brood onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that they may lie to all, ſo they ſay true to themſelues, that they thinke euerie thing lawfull (how filthie and howe diſorderly ſoeuer) that their fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſpirite telleth them, doeth it not goe ſtraitly and directly to the ouerthrowe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth? For if it ſhoulde but ſuddenly come into the giddie pate of one of their perfites, that there ought to be no Magiſtrate, or that none ought to bee better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or poſſeſſe more then other: it muſt bee by and by holden for ſo reſolute a doctrine amongeſt them,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:13"/>
as if it had beene ripely debated and decreed by all the Vniuerſities in Europe: yea (a horrible thing) as if it hadde proceeded from the ſacred mouth of GOD. And who can tell, whether theſe bee their thoughts alreadie: which they ſmother, vntill ſuch time as they haue gotten an armie to execute them.</p>
            <p>A number in this lande, vppon a falſe alarme, haue beene in a vaine iealouſie and feare of Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. Nowe the iuſtice of GOD hath payed vs. For that which was ſpoken before in ſlaunder, nowe may bee ſpoken in trueth: and that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, when it was not, is ſcarce ſuſpected when it is. For if you ſeeke after the Puritans, theſe they bee. Which although for their looſeneſſe of life, they are from the toppe to the toe nothing but blottes:<note place="margin">Iud. 12.</note> yet bragge they of all perfection, euen vnto a verie deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelues, what miſchiefe therefore yee feare might come from the Puritans, that looke for aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their handes.</p>
            <p>How beit the ouglineſſe of this Hereſie which ſhoulde driue to a feare, doeth (as it ſeemeth) make men careleſſe of it. For they thinke that ſuch a monſtrous misſhapen hereſie, ſhoulde finde lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers either verie fewe, or if anie number: yet ſuch ſweepinges of the people, as may, at good leyſure, eaſily bee caſt out. For the firſt whereof, they little knowe either what the corrupt nature of man is: or what is the deſert of the contempt of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs. For there is no wickedneſſe ſo groſſe, the print whereof our waxie and pliable nature to all euill, is not meete to receyue: and it is the Lordes iuſt iudgement, that they which haue deſpiſed the higheſt wiſedome, ſhoulde be throwne into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt follie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8542:14"/>And if anie hartning were taken, in that they are of the raſcall ſort. Firſt it is not generally true: theſe ſhameleſſe dogges thruſting themſelues (for a fatter ſoppe) into houſes of great wealth. Secondly their baſeneſſe, ſhoulde not free vs from the feare of them: if we remember that the Iuie which is ſo deſpiſed and ſo lowe a ſhrub, doth in climing by little and little, kill the talleſt and mightieſt Oake in the forreſt.<note place="margin">Actes. 19.23.</note> Take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample firſt of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Siluerſmith, who ſet the whole Citie in an vprore, agaynſt the Goſpel: and then of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copperſmith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.14.</note> of whom by the complaintes which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> maketh of him, and imprecations againſt him: it is apparaunt, that he had by him receyued more hinderance in his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then by anie other, either Doctours of the Lawe, or Princes of the common wealth. And if they were ſo ſtrengthleſſe, as they be ſuppoſed: yet the ſwarmes of them ſhoulde cauſe men to bee waking, vnleſſe they haue forgotten, that neither all the wiſedome nor power of Egypt, was able to reſiſte the armie of Lice, which the Lorde ſente againſte them. And it is to bee feared, leaſt this louſie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the familie of Loue, be ſtirred vp, not onely to beat vs, but as it were to dry beate vs: that like as the Goſpell hath beene mocked amongſt vs, ſo the Lorde ſhould choſe him ſuch rods, wherwith he might as it were in great ſcorne and diſdaine ſtrike vs againe. Such were the <hi>Hunnes, Gothes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vandales,</hi> which being rayſed out of the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, and men of whome ther was no reckoning made: yet had they ſuch ſtrength through the weake profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, ſuch greate ſucceſſe through the ſmal ſucceſſe therof, ſuch ſwiftneſſe through the ſlackneſſe in it: that ſetting vpon the mightieſt and moſte warlike nation in the world, they made in ſhort time ſuch a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of them, as if men had had to do with Mice, or fire had
<pb facs="tcp:8542:14"/>
met with Stubble: ſuch a woonderfull GOD is the Lorde, who as he oftentimes in mercie, deliuereth his by thinges of nothing: ſo againe in wrath, hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them by thinges of like value.</p>
            <p>But peraduenture, as the verie name of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde of loue, is their great glory: ſo it may breede in vs an opinon of their harmleſneſſe. For who can feare any euill from loue, which doth good to all, and hurteth none. How beit adde only (which the trueth it ſelfe doth prooue) that it is the houſholde of Selfeloue: and then what miſchiefe is there, whiche wee may not make iuſt account of, if their handes be as able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it, as their heartes are frutefull to conceiue it. For except a fewe faire ſpeaches, wherewith they would (forſooth) approue them ſelues to bee led with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Loue, and which are rather a cloke to couer their hatred againſt vs, then any wholeſome fruite of vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue: their loue is ſo lame, that it cannot ſteppe a foote out of their owne doores. And as we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to truſt to in this title, ſo they in vaunting them ſelues of it, doe but glorie in their owne ſhame. For I can as well affoord it them, to the diſcouerie of their owne fylth, as the name of Ieſuites vnto the Papiſtes, which pride themſelues therein. For as they leauing the title of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to vs in the holy ſcripture,<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> and coyning a new of their owne braine, carrie the note of their intollerable arrogancie in their forehead, red of all which vnderſtand anie thing of Chriſtian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: euen ſo alſo is it in this vermin. For beſides their pride, whereby they haue ſought them ſelues a title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from others: what an intollerable arrogancie is it, to leaue the titles of the ſcripture,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> for a liking they haue to thoſe of their owne forge? For if they would needes ſingle themſelues by a ſeuerall name: why tooke they not the name of the houſeholde of fayth mencioned in
<pb facs="tcp:8542:15"/>
the Scripture, rather then the name of the houſeholde of Loue, wherof there is no ſuch mention.</p>
            <p>The ſame or not vnlike iudgement, of their ſtrange phraſes, wherewith they apparell and ſet foorth their ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge opinions &amp; deuiſes: that to thoſe which haue their ſences wel inured to diſcerne of doctrines, it will be as eaſy thereby to diſcry their new learning, as it is to know an outlandiſh man by his toung or ſpeach. For they are ſo ſwelling, as if they had feared leaſt they ſhould not haue beene ſufficiently knowen, to bee of thoſe deceiuers,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 18. Iude. 16.</note> which the Apoſtles Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> haue marked out: vnleſſe they had ſhewed vs this brande, which the holie Apoſtles did ſet vpon their tounges. Albeit to ſay the trueth, in this manner of handeling, there is not more pride, then crafte and deceite. For therefore, no doubt, doe they ſo farre paſſe and exceede the meaſure of the common ſpeach: that the ruder ſorte not able to vnderſtand them, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtonied, might be as it were hanged in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Whereof if I ſhould giue you a paterne, I could not doe it more aptely then in ſending you to the gibberiſh of our Rogues, or of the counterfait ſort of Egyptians: which were woonte to haue a ſpeciall chat: wherewithall they amazed the ſimple men, whileſt they drewe them into their nettes. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, it is moſt vnlike the language of the holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. For in ſteede that it doeth vtter graue and high matters, in a lowe and familiar ſtile: they ſet forth their trifling and halfepeny doctrines, with loftie and high phraſes of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Nowe it remayneth, that for the glory of God ſo ſhamefully defaced, for the trueth ſo ſlaunderouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, for the Church ſo grieuouſly ſtricken, for the common wealth preſently wounded, &amp; further hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
<pb facs="tcp:8542:15"/>
that all thoſe to whome the Lord hath giuen any meanes of ſtopping this gap, where at his wrath hath thus broken in vpon vs, make haſt to the reſcue of the trueth, and reſiſtance of the euill.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore we muſt all humble our ſelues vnder the reuenging hand of GOD, in prayer and faſting, in ſackcloth and aſhes: that if by ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudge, and confeſſing our giltineſſe of crime, wee doe put the halter as it were aboute our owne necks, hee may peraduenture haue compaſſion on vs, and repente him bothe of this, and other the euils which hee threateneth againſt vs. The exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought (without all controuerſie) to bee publike: to the end, that the Church with all hir Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lying proſtrate before his Maieſtie, all their cryes &amp; complaints at once ſent vp, may ſo ring in his eares, as that he may be the rather moued to pittie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her. But if it be holden out, from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblyes: then the Lorde caſteth this charge of ſanctifying a faſt vppon priuate and common hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And if the priuate houſes bee ſparred againſt it, through their careleſſe Maiſters: yet let euery faithfull perſon, who trembleth and quaketh when the Lorde roareth, take him to his Chamber for the humbling and ſubmitting of himſelfe before his GOD.</p>
            <p>Then her Maieſtie is heere moſte humbly to bee deſired, that that God which hath preſerued her roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſon vnto the crowne, and in the crowne, from all the treaſons intended againſt her: may haue her ſword (or rather his owne ſwoorde committed vnto her) drawne vppon theſe horrible treaſons, which are in a high hand committed directly againſt his own perſon: to the launchinge of ſuch as are curable, and to the
<pb facs="tcp:8542:16"/>
quite cutting off of thoſe that are deſperate, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines eſpecially. Her moſte honourable Councel, is likewiſe moſt humbly to be deſired, that they would ſo croude vp other their weightie and graue conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that this alſo which in weightineſſe, giueth place but vnto few, may haue the rowme that it deſerueth. Namely how her Maieſties Swoorde, may be moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and rightly handeled, for the ſpeedieſt and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualleſt riddaunce heereof. Her worſhipfull Iuſtices and other inferiour Magiſtrates, that they would ſo diligently waite vppon the execution: as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the greater haſt they make againſt them, the greater ſtay the Lorde will make in his iudgement againſt vs. The carefull miniſters of the land, that they would not onely labour to kepe their flockes from the contagion of this peſtilence: but ſeek alſo to pull ſuch out of the fire, as through ſimple ignorance haue fallen into it. The godly people, that they would remember dayly ſo to commend the good ſucceſſe of both the miniſteries, of the worde and of the ſworde, vnto the Lord: that the proſpering in the ſubduing of this dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable hereſy, it may (by continuance of a godly peace) go well with them and theirs after them. So ſhall not onely the euill it ſelfe, but alſo the ſlaunderous charges againſt the Goſpel, be cleane wiped away: whileſt the hereſies which ſprang without the fault of the Goſpel, ſhall be remooued by the power of the Goſpel: &amp; whilſt the euils which roſe through the ſleepineſſe of ſome of the profeſſors, ſhall be put downe through the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of them all: whileſt finally this hereſie being of ſome confuted, of other ſome puniſhed, prayed againſt of all: the Goſpell may haue a greater triumph in the conqueſt of this hereſie, then if it had neuer beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded by it.</p>

For conſidering firſt the dark and deceauing words, the new phraſes, and blaſphemous allegoryes wherwith the Family of Loue, fill their bookes, which ſpeaches may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thus if they will, and otherwiſe if they liſte, chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with euery change of perſon in that family as he is more or leſſe vrged, or able to anſwere, or as may moſt deceiue or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde a miſchief: Secondarily noting that they deny princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and groundes of Religion, ſcorning the ground of all grounds, the moſt holy Scriptures of God, &amp; that in the moſt holy poyntes touching the perſon and offices of Chriſt Ieſus, our iuſtification and ſanctification: thirdly finding that they haue a double hart &amp; a chaungeable tounge, renouncing and recanting before Magiſtrates, and vpon their commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the world that they maintained, and are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued notwithſtanding to maintaine ſtill in ſworne obedience to <hi>H.N.</hi> according to the like practiſe of counterfaiting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who make ſhew of religion hauing ſworne hearts to the Pope, whoſe diſpenſation either they haue, or truſt in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling reliques and ceremonyes from Rome: for theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I thought it ſome danger to lay open ſuche blaſphemyes, ſuch eſcapes of an euill and erronious conſcience, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning long agoe in the ancient heretiques, the <hi>Priſcilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes, Montaniſts, Pelagians, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts &amp;c.</hi> and hauing been long time buried in the botome of

But, my good brother, theſe my doubts grew from the eye I had to their will and way: finding the Serpent ſo ſubtile to charme others, &amp; yet him ſelfe to ſhut his care ſo againſt the trueth, that he will not heare the voyce of the charmer, charme hee neuer ſo wiſely: and that it is as hard to finde out his way, as the way of a Ship that hath ſayled through the ſea.</p>
            <p>For afterwarde conſidering that Antichriſt did bring (as he thought) to perfection the myſtery of iniquitie in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king force of Satan, in all powers and ſignes and lying woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in all deceit of vnrighteouſneſſe, as S.

I acknowledge with praiſe to God the father in Ieſus Chriſt for that ſword of the ſpirit, that two edged ſwoord, that it is able either to heale, or to wounde to death all aduerſary power, be it either in al impietie of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or in all corruption of maners. Yea if <hi>H.N.</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all his ſinne, and waſhed from all corruption: If he in deede were, as he is in the fancie of his familie an angell from heauen, or by an other tranſubſtantiation more then an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changell, or that which they affirme and I dare not write: yet teaching otherwiſe then we haue receiued from the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, he is to be holden accurſſed, and his Goſpell of the kingdom with all other his doctrine to be had in abhomination. They that pray, are thus to pray againſt ſuch hereſies: they that write, are ſo, vpon occaſion to write, and Magiſtrates are in a zeale of Gods houſe to put on that minde, that the holy trueth may bee exalted, and all hereſies rooted out to the glory of GOD, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

of his Churche from thoſe damnable waies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many, not eſteeming nor ſeeking the trueth, are ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, then they can feare deſtruction. Therfore you haue doone wel in the Lord, drawing out that ſworde of the worde of God, to make a ſeparation betweene thought and thought, betweene practiſe and practiſe, betweene ſecret &amp; open paths of errour and contempt, betwene ioynts and marrow, betwene ſoule and ſpirit, that all the outgoings &amp; eſcapes and dennes wherein theſe hereſies either lye in waite and worke againſt the trueth, or hide themſelues from diſcouery, may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and the bright face of the trueth appeare to the great glory of God, ouerthrowing of al error, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting thoſe of that family of Loue, whom he hath loued and in mercie will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, deliuering their eyes from blindeneſſe and feete fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and to ſtay thoſe that might, for want of the voice of the trumpet, ſodenly fal into the enemies hand, to be caried away into the miſerable captiuitie of thoſe hereſies, and to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death that followeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their iuſt reward. Alſo the Magiſtrate by ſuch a manifeſt diſcouery of thoſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt God, againſt his Chriſt, againſt his worde, ſhall more &amp; more ſee into the great danger of their horrible ſect, and find neceſſary cauſe to ioyne with the worde to cut it off, leſt in the end they with their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelues aſmuch againſt the holy and neceſſary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte of magiſtrates, as they doe already againſt God and his word, by whome Princes raigne &amp; receiue their bleſſed peace and ſafetie. Againſt which Magiſtrates this practiſe they haue vſed and ſtill doe vſe, abuſing their holy place of Iuſtice: they recant in woordes, without recantation in heart (as I noted before) holding it for a rule, that they ought not to deſtroy the Temple of GOD (whiche is ſay they in a groſſe and abſurde interpretation) our body: and therefore we will not be brought to perſecution and death. Making a rule againſt the rule of Chriſt, and againſt the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull practiſe thereof in him ſelfe, and his holy Martyres:

            <p>Praying alſo that God would continue with increaſe that ſpirit of zeale and wiſdome in the heart of our moſt excellent ſoueraine the Queene &amp; other in authoritie vnder her, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe thoſe fantaſticall and erronious ſpirits, being indeed the true ſucceſſion of thoſe ancient <hi>Cathariſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Puritans,</hi> who thought themſelues not to ſinne, but actually to bee poſſeſſed with abſolute holineſſe and pureneſſe. For ſo thoſe thinke of themſelues, and plainly affirme it of their illuminate elders. But howſoeuer they ſeduce ſome goodly and zealous men &amp; women of honeſt and godly conuerſation, placing them at the porch of their Synagogue, to make a ſhewe of holineſſe, and to ſtand there as baites and ſtalles to deceiue others: yet alas who can without bluſhing vtter the ſhame that is committed in the inwarde roomes, and as it were in the heart of that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan. Theſe are the things I haue thought tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the booke, and a teſtimonie of my greate ioy touching the ſame. And beſides the good I haue already noted this confutation ſhal teſtifie to all ages at large that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gouernment of our gratious ſoueraigne the Queenes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſuffereth neither Papiſts nor other heretiques to goe vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed or vnpuniſhed, howſoeuer firſt in great abundance of ſingular clemencie it pleaſeth her to ſeeke their ſaluation &amp; draw on their effectuall conuerſation.

For he wil not ſeeme to ſay that thing, which two or three, ſhall not be redy to witneſſe with hym. VVe are therefore to heare what theſe can ſay to that point. In the ſixt of <hi>Iohn</hi> he directeth vs by this letter <hi>(f)</hi> vnto this Scripture (conteyned in the <hi>54.</hi> verſe) <hi>Whoſoeuer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> Heere is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made vnto all true chriſtians (for they onely haue their hartes prepared by faith to digeſt the fleſh and blood of Chriſte:) that the Lorde will raiſe them vppe at the laſte day, which wee call the day of iudgement, and the ſeconde comming of Chriſte. The promiſe I graunt is paſt, but the day taken to performe the couenant, is yet to come. For by the promiſe it is playne, that wee may not looke to haue the matter perfourmed, before the laſte day, which is the ſeconde comming of Chriſte. I wil not here call it into queſtion, whether <hi>H. N.</hi> be one of them, who eate his fleſhe, and drinke his blood, that ſhall go as graunted at this time, onely this I will ſaye, that hee is to begge ſhamefully, who with no other helpe, then that hee hath from hence, ſhall obteine ſo muche as a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common ſorte of Chriſtians: but hee that will vppon this warrant, deale as a Prophete and Teacher in the Churche: It cannot be excuſed, but that he doeth felloniouſly enter, breake in and ſteale: For there is no colour of anie good title, to bee ſhewed for the ſame. Now I pray you conſider of his argument, which is this: The Lorde will raiſe vppe all his faithfull at the laſt day, and therefore <hi>H. N.</hi> is already riſen from the dead. The matter is eſtabliſhed as doone, but the grounde is no other, then a graunt and promiſe made in expreſſe woordes, for the time yet to come: For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſte ſayth playnely, that hee will raiſe them vp at the laſte day. Where there is not only noted a time
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8542:19"/>
to come, but of that time alſo, the laſte and furtheſt day is taken: and yet yee ſee, that <hi>H. N.</hi> will haue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be alreadie accompliſhed in him ſelfe and that not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then by vertue of this promiſe. Let that bee graunted which <hi>H.N</hi> hath begged, and let his feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acte, for once bee pardoned: yet hath hee proceeded no farther in proofe, then that hee ought to be taken as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet riſen from the dead with condition, to wit, if that the day of iuddgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alredy be paſt, The Lord open the eies of his familie, leaſte as hee is no Prophet, vnleſſe that bee paſte, which is yet to come: ſo they in like maner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no true Chriſtians, before that, which is for euer paſt, heereafter ſhall come. If the cauſe of ſuche confuſion bee demaunded, this it is: He expoundeth the doctrine of our reſurrection Allegorically, and taketh it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els: but to ryſe in our iudgemente and affection, from the likyng of all other, too the embracing of his doctrine and religion. And therefore the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which wee looke for, is in his opinion, already come, becauſe the troumpe of his doctrine now ſoundeth, which woorketh this his ſpiritual reſurrection. The confutation whereof, you ſhall (God willing) haue more at large heereafter, and yet there is ſufficient, euen in this place aleadged by him to ouerthrowe it. For ſpeaking of the children of GOD, who are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, poſſeſſed by fayth of eternall life, and therefore already ryſen from the dead, (becauſe to riſe from errour, to the imbraſing of the trueth, (which hee taketh his owne doctrine too bee) is with him the riſing from the dead, euen) of thoſe hee ſayth, I will rayſe them vp in the laſt day: appoynting an other reſurrection yet to come for thoſe: who by a true faith haue alredy taken holde of that ſpiritual riſing from darkneſſe to light, from ſinne and iniquitie, to righteouſneſſe and true chriſtianitie.

If his beſt bulwarke, appointed to beare of the firſt and greateſt aſſault that ſhal be made againſt him, bee thus weake: there is good hope, it wilbe no great woorke too winne the hold it ſelfe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Actes. 17.31</note>His ſeconde confirmation, is taken out of the <hi>Acts, 17.</hi> verſe <hi>31.</hi> The woordes be theſe: <hi>God wil iudge the worlde in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath geuen aſſurance vnto al, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> A place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar vnto Chriſte alone, whom God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath raiſed from corporall death, to be an aſſuraunce vnto vs, that hee is the man appointed, who ſhal iudge the world in righteouſneſſe, at the latter day. There can be no other place more peculiar and proper vnto Chriſte, then is this: whereunto for all that, <hi>H. N.</hi> wilbe entituled. Notwithſtanding, yf the woorde of GOD haue geuen it vnto him, good reaſon hee ſhoulde enioy it. Let it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee conſidered, what he hath ſaide for it. This is his reaſon: GOD hath geuen vs aſſuraunce, that hee will iudge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man Chriſt, in that hee hath rayſed hym from the dead: therefore <hi>H. N.</hi> is alreadie riſen from the dead. If <hi>H. N.</hi> bee Chriſt, it foloweth neceſſarily, though not by force of this argument, yet by ſufficient ſtrength from the trueth of the matter it ſelfe, that he ſhoulde be ryſen from the dead, becauſe hee is the ſame perſon, of whom it is ſayde, that he is already riſen from the dead, to aſſure vs of the laſt iudgement, that it ſhalbe holden by him ſelfe: But if <hi>H.N.</hi> bee anie thing beſide Chriſte, there is no maner of helpe, to bee had from this place. For hee ſpeaketh playnely heere, of the bodyly death of Chriſte him ſelfe. As for the affinitie betweene <hi>H. N.</hi> and Chriſte, howe great it is, that ſhall GOD willing hereafter appeare. What ſhal we be able to hold free from his aſſaults, when he ſhameth not to geue the attempt, for breaking of ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8542:20"/>
ſtrong barres as theſe bee, and that to gette the poſſeſſion from Chriſt himſelfe? <hi>Cicero</hi> doth geue it foorth of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that there was almoſt no man to bee founde, who had not rather yeelde to his requeſt, how vnreaſonable ſoeuer, then once to enter into the fielde with him for to fight: <hi>Nec ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc ferè inueni, qui non concedendum putaret Caeſari, quod poſtularet, potiùs quam pugnandum.</hi> But (we are to reioyſe in it) it fareth farre otherwiſe with the captayne of this bande, for he is ſo ſhameleſſe in demaundes, and ſo fooliſh in his fight, that he would tempte the mildeſt man that is, to take his owne weapon from him, and to beate him with it vnto blood, before once hee begonne to reaſon the matter for his requeſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt aucthoritie, alleadged for proofe that <hi>H.N.</hi> is raiſed from the dead, is taken out of the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and ſixth verſe:<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. ver. 6.</note> theſe bee the wordes: <hi>God which is rich in mercie, euen when we were dead by ſinnes, hath quickened vs together in Chriſt and hath rayſed vs vppe together.</hi> A bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite flowing from Almightie God, vnto euerie member of his, to be quickened and rayſed vp in Chriſte, and by his grace, from the death of ſinne. If it ſhall fall out by plaine proofe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come to ſpeake of Chriſt, that <hi>H.N.</hi> denieth both his perſon, &amp; his office: then hath he no maner of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or ſhewe of reaſon at all out of this place. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of here, is ſaide to be in, and by Chriſt. But bee it, that his iudgement tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt were ſound, the contrarie whereof (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) ſhall hereafter playnely appeare: yet this ſpoken of men approued both in doctrine, and in life, and that by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle himſelfe: is no proofe to induce thoſe to thinke, that <hi>H.N.</hi> is riſen from the deade, by whom his life as well as doctrine, ſhall at any tyme (as now it is) be called into queſtion. I hope <hi>H.N.</hi> wil neuer goe aboute, to haue goodes that be priuate, made common
<pb facs="tcp:8542:21"/>
in his familie, ſeeing that himſelf turneth things common vnto his owne priuate vſe. For this place is common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ali true Chriſtians: wherein notwithſtanding <hi>H N.</hi> cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth propertie. For otherwiſe what reaſon is it, that euery one, who is riſen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin, ſhould therfore haue the place &amp; authoritie of a Prophet in the Churche.</p>
               <p>It remayneth nowe to conſider, with what iudgement or conſcience, <hi>H N.</hi> hath ioyned together theſe teſtimonies, for the proofe of one matter. So ſhall we come to ſome ſight of his dangerous doctrine. The firſt teſtimonie (as you ſee) plainely ſpeaketh of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the laſt day The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Chriſt his riſing from death corporally. The third of riſing from ſinne &amp; iniquitie. Theſe, how diuerſe ſoeuer one from an other, are notwithſtanding by <hi>H. N.</hi> yoked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for ſtrengthening of one and the ſame matter. And the reaſon thereof is, becauſe hee taketh the doctrine touching the reſurrection vnto life at the ſeconde comming of Chriſt: And the doctrine alſo of Chriſt his bodily riſing agayne from death: to be vnderſtoode onely of riſing from ſinne, &amp; to leaue no other doctrine beſide that vnto vs. You perceiue then by this doctrine wee are depriued, both of the comfort comming vnto vs by Chriſt his dying in the fleſh, and alſo of the hope that we ſhal riſe vp at the laſt day, both in bodie, &amp; ſoule, to inherit euerlaſting life. For both of theſe are ſunke vp by his doctrine, into one onely ſpirituall riſing from ſinne: and that not otherwiſe, then by imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his religion and doctrine, for the gouernment of our liues.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtuffe that hee hath bounde together, for drawing of himſelfe out from among the dead. But if the lines of his life, had bene no more able to haue holden him among the liuing, then theſe cordes are to pull him out from among the dead: then (I am well aſſured) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhoulde long before this time, haue loſt one principall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8542:21"/>
factor for him, here vpon earth.</p>
               <p>When this Author addeth more, that this his riſing from death is according to the prouidence of God, and his promiſes, he ſendeth vs for proofe hereof, vnto the eight chapter of the Romanes, and by theſe letters, C. and D. vnto the thirtienth and twentie three verſes thereof. In the thirtienth verſe it is thus written: <hi>If ye liue after the fleſhe, ye ſhall die, but if ye mortifie the deedes of the bodie by the ſpirite, yee ſhall liue.</hi> His reaſon is this: The children of GOD, who by his ſpirite morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deedes of the fleſhe in this life, ſhall in the worlde to come liue for euer: therefore by vertue of this promiſe <hi>H. N.</hi> is alreadie riſen from the dead. Hee claimeth ſtill his olde priuiledge, that it may be lawfull for him by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall diſpenſation, to make that which is yet to come, to be alreadie done: euerlaſting life, to bee in this life: and the reſurrection in the laſt day, to be no other thing then the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſinne. If this abſurde kinde of reaſoning, had ben his gheaſt but for one night, the matter might happily haue had ſome colour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning excuſe: but beyng a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of his, downe lying and vpriſing with him euery day: there is no place left for any defence, to cleare him of the ſhame and infamie thereof. Meruayle no more therefore, why <hi>H. N.</hi> ſhoulde in all his writinges, ſo ſore inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture Learned (as he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:) it was no ſmal poynt of wiſedome to complayne firſt. For he was well aſſured it coulde neuer bee, that learning ſhoulde at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne anie ſuch portion of pacience, as were able to beare the weight of halfe that wrong, which hee had in purpoſe to lay vpon it. In the <hi>23.</hi> verſe it is thus written. <hi>We alſo which haue receiued the firſt fruites of his ſpirite, euen we do ſigh in ourſelues, wayting for the adoption euen the redemption of our body.</hi> This is then his reaſon, the faithfull doe waite for the adoption &amp; reſurrection: therefore it muſt be by promiſe, that <hi>H. N.</hi> is alredy riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead.
<pb facs="tcp:8542:22"/>
Howe repugnant vnto all ſhew of reaſon and truth is this, that <hi>H. N.</hi> ſhoulde therfore be riſen from the dead, becauſe the children of God, doe yet waite for the reſurrection? In effect he ſaith thus much: There is a thing which ſhortly is like to be loſt, and therefore <hi>H. N.</hi> hath alreadie founde it. Who can yeeld to ſuch abſurde concluſions, vnleſſe it be proued vnto him before, that <hi>H N.</hi> hath a ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to finde thinges before they be loſt, and to take them vp, when as yet they are not fallen? Howe heauie is the hande of God, vppon hereſie and idolatrie? and howe great is the blindneſſe that they be in, and yet perceiue it not?<note place="margin">1. Sam. 5.</note> palpable was that blindneſſe of the men of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> who ceaſſed not to worſhip their God Dagon, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they did ſee him fallen before the Arke, &amp; his head ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a parte from his bodie: But yet this familie doth farre paſſe them, for they doe bring into the worlde, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here as God, one <hi>H. N:</hi> who is not remoued a little from his head, but vtterly without any head, iudgement, or ſenſe at all: his proofes being generally ſuch, as reaſon and iudgement doe vtterly renounce. The Lorde in mercie keepe vs from thoſe ſinnes, which in due deſert, doe ſo cloſe vp our eyes, as wee can ſee no thing at high noone day.</p>
               <p>An other Title, which he taketh vpon himſelfe, is, that he is annoynted with the holie Ghoſte, in the olde age of the holy vnderſtanding of Ieſu Chriſt. This title he clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be giuen him from the Apoſtle, in the <hi>4.</hi> chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> verſe <hi>13.</hi> Where, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the diuerſitie of giftes, that were in the Church, ſaieth. <hi>God hath geuen ſome to bee Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, ſome Euangeliſtes, ſome Paſtors and teachers, for the gathering together of the ſaintes: &amp;c.</hi> giuing the reaſon withall: to witte, that wee might growe vp to be men in Chriſt, and to be no longer as children, readie to bee carried away with euerie winde of doctrine. Hee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8542:22"/>
telleth vs then, what a good order the Lord hath left in his Church, to keepe vs from the daunger of errour, and to make vs like men growne, to bee ſtrongly ſtayed in the trueth: But we heare nothing, what ſpeciall ſucceſſe, this ordinance of the Lord hath had with <hi>H N.</hi> For what a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this: Apoſtles &amp; Paſtours are giuen of God to keepe his Church from errour, and to make them as men ſtrong and ſtayed in the trueth: and therefore <hi>H. N.</hi> is ſtrongly ſtayed in the trueth, <hi>or</hi> (as it liketh him rather to ſpeake) <hi>therefore H. N. is annointed with the holy ghoſt, in the olde age of the holy vnderſtanding of Ieſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon order taken for procuring things to be done, <hi>H. N.</hi> will neceſſarily enforce that the ſame are done. He might with as good reaſon ſay, that becauſe there is a law in this lande againſt theft, therefore euerie man liueth iuſtly and truely of his owne, and there is not a theefe to be heard of in this realme. For vpon no other warrant then this, that order is left in the Church, to keepe men ſtaied and ſtrong in the trueth: <hi>H. N.</hi> wil inferre it muſt of neceſſitie be, that himſelfe is ſtayed in that trueth. He proceedeth further in his titles, as not taking himſelfe ſufficiently commended hitherto: and affirmeth that he is godded with God, in the ſpirit of his loue, and referreth vs for the triall of this title, vnto the <hi>21.</hi> Chapter of the Reuelation, and third verſe, as vnto the beſt euidence that he can bring: and therefore he hath dealt wiſely, to leaue the other chapters without anie ſpecialtie. In this place, the ſtate of the godly is deſcribed, what it ſhall be in the life to come: to wit, that they ſhall be glorified, &amp; enioy the preſence of their God, being freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all griefe and paine. The wordes of the text be theſe:<note place="margin">Reuela. 21.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I heard a great voice out of heauen, ſaying, behold the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God with men, &amp; he wil dwel with them, &amp; they ſhalbe his people, &amp; God himſelf ſhalbe their God with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; God ſhal wipe all teares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their eyes, and there ſhalbe no more death, neither ſorow, neither pain</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8542:23"/>
Becauſe it is ſayd in the text, that God ſhall be their God with them, ſo that they ſhall enioy his glorious preſence, whereas albeit he bee nowe their GOD, yet he is not their GOD with them, in that glorie which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the preſence of his Maieſtie: <hi>H.N.</hi> reaſoneth thus: <hi>God ſhall be God with his people:</hi> and therefore <hi>H. N.</hi> is GOD with God, or godded with GOD. It aſketh no paines of me, in manie woordes to ſet theſe two partes aſunder, that is perfourmed in the ſame labour that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them togither. For it is neuer better ſeene, how white and blacke differ, then when they come once to be vewed the one with the other. Can not God haue licence to dwell with his people in the life to come, except before there ſhal paſſe a graunt to <hi>H.N.</hi> to bee godded, or made God with God here in this life? or if there were any ſuch compact, doeth this place prooue it, that hath not ſo much as a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable ſounding that way? Can not God be with them, but therevpon it muſt follow, that they bee Godded with him? If there were any ſuch thing in trueth, as (God willing) it ſhal hereafter appeare, there cannot be: yet this place doth not ſo much as with a good countenaunce comforte him therein. The place, being ſo direct for our comfort in the life to come, and for all that, by him included within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of this life: telleth vs, that he hath not yet chaunged his iudgement touching euerlaſting life, but that here (in his opinion) all that is to be hoped for muſt be had. As for the title it ſelf [to be godded with God:] it is a blaſphemie not to be borne.

               <p>In the next title, he challengeth againe, that which is proper and peculiar onely vnto Chriſt in that he is God, that is, to be the true light of the perfect being. For in that place wherevnto hee appealeth for defence, after a plaine deniall of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, to bee the true light, it

is verified of Chriſt, <hi>That he was the true light,</hi>

                  <hi>which lighteneth euerie man that commeth into the worlde.</hi> Giuing him this prerogatiue aboue Angels, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that hee is the true light, ſhining of, and in himſelfe, whereas all other borow their brightneſſe of him. What will this man bee aſhamed of, who dare to ſay of himſelfe, <hi>that he is that true light, which lighteneth euerie man that commeth into the worlde,</hi> for ſo be the very wordes of that place, wherevnto he ſendeth vs? what can bee more blaſphemous, then to lay claime to that, which belongeth not vnto Chriſt himſelfe but onely in reſpect of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. This blaſphemie is yet more euident in that which foloweth. For there it is thus written: <hi>God is light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and in him is no darkeneſſe at all,</hi> therevpon <hi>H. N.</hi> concludeth himſelfe to be the true light. Theſe blaſphemies, if a man ſhould deale with them in deſert, are rather by open execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be repelled, then to haue the honour of anie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, though not otherwiſe then by confutation. Thus much of his perſon: Nowe to his office.</p>
               <p>Touching his office, he ſayth, <hi>that he is elected to bee a miniſter of the gracious worde, which is nowe in the laſt time raiſed vp by God, according to his promiſes.</hi> He bringeth nothing for proofe of this his election, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ouer as a matter out of doubt: and yet might it well bee, that the woorde whereof hee is a Miniſter, were a gracious woorde, (as hee calleth it) and for all that his election therevnto neither good nor gracious. But woulde you heare, what this gracious woorde is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prophet teſtifieth of it? Surely it is no other thing, then euen now to bring vs the firſt newes of a matter done and paſt manie hundreth yeares agoe, to witte, that <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhoulde bee inhabited againe by the Iewes, after the captiuitie of <hi>Babilon.</hi> In the place which he alledgeth out of the Prophete, it is written thus: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, againe there ſhall be heard in this

place, which ye ſay ſhal be deſolate, without ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beaſt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the cities of Iuda, and the ſtreetes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi>

                  <hi>the voice of ioy, and the voice of gladneſſe, the voice of the bridegrome, &amp; the voice of the bride. For I will cauſe to returne the captiuitie of the land, as at the firſt.</hi> The Iewes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted by the prophet, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, that they ſhal returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their captiuity, and inhabite <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with comfort and ioy of heart. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there ſhall be heard in your ſtreetes, the voice of ioy &amp; gladnes, the voice of the bridegrome and the voice of the bride. H.N.</hi> might well haue ſtayed among the dead, &amp; neuer haue ſtriuen ſo much about his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from among them, if he haue no other meſſage then this: for they are dead many hundreth yeares agoe, to whom this matter did apperteine. It is plaine therefore by his own teſtimonie, that he hath no authority to deale with vs, but with <hi>Iuda</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> nor to bring anie doctrine into the world, touching euerlaſting ſaluation: but onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a temporall deliuerance: neither to haue any thing to doe with men nowe liuing, but with people long before this time deade. Thus much in particular both touching his perſon and his office.</p>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I beſeche you mark the diuerſitie of this doctrine, from that which is deliuered touching this matter, in the holy ſcriptures. In the Scripture we doe reade of one man, by name <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt offendour among men:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.15.</note> heere is no
<pb facs="tcp:8542:31"/>
mention made of any one man,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.22</note> but the blame is wholy (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his accuſtomed obſcure and dark dealing) put ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to a generall and confuſed notion, which is called of him (the man) and that his (the man) is no one man,<note place="margin">By the doctrine of H.N. Adam was no one man.</note> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that which was euen nowe alleaged out of the fourth Chapter. For no one man hath continued from the beginning vntyll this day, to receiue continuall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the Lorde: And you haue hearde that hee ſaith, wee will declare from the time foorth of the falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or diſobedience of the man, the earneſt loue which God hath alwaies vntill this ſame day, ſhewed towardes the man. It is playne therefore, that his (the man) is ſet heere, to hide an horrible errour, to wit, the mankinde hath no common harme,<note place="margin">Man hath no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon infection from Adam, or any other one man.</note> from any one man. For he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we haue no infection from any man, otherwiſe then ſo ſo farre foorth, as we ſhal in doing the like euil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come folowers of that man. So that by his doctrine, any euill man, may be an occaſion of as great hurt vnto vs, as was <hi>Adam.</hi> In the Scripture wee doe reade of one principal offendour, &amp; we do likewiſe reade there, of one particular &amp; yet principal offence: to wit, the eating of the forbidden fruit, which brought the gilte of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vpon al. This authour deliuereth that point of the particular offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in like maner generally vnto vs in theſe woordes <hi>The man from the beginning, fel away from or was diſobedient vnto the woorde of his God, the vpright life of his true light.</hi> Some not of the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that familie, with whom I haue had conference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this doctrine of <hi>H. N.</hi> haue in plaine ſpeache told me, that there was no material tree, neither was it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny material, fruite that <hi>Adam</hi> did eate, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was therfore ſaid to eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euil, becauſe in tranſgreſſing the will of GOD; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> mingled euill with that goodneſſe which was in him,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8542:31"/>
and ſo was founde to haue doone euill, aſwell as good. When this familie doth not acknowledge this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar offence, it followeth neceſſarily that they ſhoulde bee altogeather ignoraunt, both of the number vnto howe many that infection reacheth, and alſo of the daunger thereof growing vnto the ſame. In the woorde of God it is plaine, eſpecially in the Epiſtle vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>That one offence, brought condemnation vpon all men.</hi> Where one offence of one offendour, is ſet againſt one righteouſneſſe, of one righteous man <hi>Ieſus Chriſte.</hi> For as <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſpring from whence flowed corruption vnto all, and in whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, wee all had offended, as being a part or parcell of him, cloſed vp within his loines: ſo Chriſt in like maner is the roote of all righteouſneſſe, in whoſe obedience, all the faithful are founde innocent and reckoned as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before the Lorde. The doctrine which deliuereth vnto vs how daungerous a diſeaſe, wee haue from <hi>Adam,</hi> is a chiefe point of our religion, that doth principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs. For the diſeaſe is ſo daungerous, that it doeth infect vnto death, bringing with it condemnation: and ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal, that it denieth priuilege vnto any, ſcattering deadly poyſon euery where and ouer all. And therefore if <hi>H. N.</hi> were ſounde in all other points of religion. yet this one errour of his touching originall ſinne were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cut him of as a rotten member from the Churche of Chriſte, vntill hee ſhoulde confeſſe his faulte, renounce this his hereſie, and with the Church of GOD profeſſe the trueth of that doctrine, which touching Originall ſinne, is deliuered vnto vs in the worde of GOD. The infection that commeth by <hi>Adam</hi> is not an euil w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out vs not able otherwiſe to harme vs, then when we ſhall drawe ſo neare as that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:8542:32"/>
which woulde both counſaile and and practiſe wickednes, though there were no former example thereof through the whole worlde. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that he was by nature the childe of wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſians. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>as wel as others:</hi> He ſemeth to finde a fountaine of ſinne in nature, as nowe it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in <hi>Adam:</hi> but not to charge any man, or men, by euil example of life, to haue beene the occaſion of that wrath, and curſe of GOD. So that infection of nature, not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of example, is the grounde of all our griefe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill beeyng ſo neare vnto vs as is our nature, hath the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite with vs of our beſt and next neighbour, before wee be warned of it by the word: not the light regarde, which is commonly had of a forener and ſtranger. But the word teacheth that it ought not lightly to feare vs, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie without vs, againſt whom are ſhutte the gates of all our hartes, aſwell as of our holdes: And caſteth ſo great care vpon vs to withſtand it, as is required to driue out an enimie already within our gates, and poſſeſſed of our ſtrongeſt holdes. Let <hi>H. N.</hi> therefore haue that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and entertainement with all good Chriſtians, that hee deſerueth who certifieth of our enimie, that hee is yet in his owne lande, when hee hath entred our chiefe cities and walled townes. Or let his fees bee the ſame with thoſe counſellours, by whoſe aduiſe all our munition is ſent into foraine Countreies to war vpon them: when before they are priuie, that ſubiectes are redy to riſe vp and rebel in our owne lande. In <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> there was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto euery woman,<note place="margin">Leuiticus. 12.</note> which had brought forth ſeed, and borne a childe: that ſhe ſhould bring vnto the Prieſt a ſinne offering, after the daies of her purifiyng were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: to the ende he might make an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for her, &amp; ſo purge her of her blood. A notable example to let vs ſee the ſpring of ſinne, that wee may be humbled in our vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and being diſcharged of hypocriſie, may conſider how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8542:32"/>
lowly we ought to be in our owne eyes, whoſe birth is ſo polluted, that our mothers become therwith all fouly ſlai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Let vs therefore ſay with <hi>Iob</hi> not in impaciencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, but in all humbling of our ſelues:<note place="margin">Iob. 14.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthineſſe?</hi> Let vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with <hi>Dauid</hi> (Who came not in hipocriſie excuſing him ſelfe to accuſe his mother: but in humilitie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him ſelfe, that hee might be pardoned of the Lord:) confeſſe that our mothers haue warmed vs in ſin,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> and that we haue been borne in iniquitie. Let vs begin at the head, and hide nothing from the Lorde: So ſhall our conſcience be cleared, and our prouiſion made in trueth for aſſured peace. As for that queſtion, common to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes with the familie of Loue: howe this infection is conueighed from <hi>Adam</hi> into his poſteritie: Whether by the body, or by the ſoule: ſeeing thus much is plaine by the ſcriptures, that there it is, And from <hi>Adam</hi> it came: It is altogeather curious and vnprofitable. It were a more profitable queſtion, to diſcuſſe howe wee might haue it with leaſt hurt, ſeing we cannot be rid of it altogeather, then to examine howe it is entred into vs. And he that ſhal caſt of the care, how to rid him of the daunger of it, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a diſputation howe hee fell into it: is no leſſe fooliſhe in my iudgement, then yf a man, thruſte by another into a deepe and dangerous pit, ſhoulde refuſe to ſpeake of his comming out, enquiring only of them that came by, who he was that did hurle him in: And when hee is reſolued therin: wil haue it further debated, (while he is yet in the pit, &amp; before once he thinketh of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out, whether the man (in their iudgments) preuayled againſt him, becauſe his heart fainted, or becauſe his ſtrength failed. Nowe if the Lord be cleere, &amp; not to be touched, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth harden the harts of the wicked &amp; puniſheth ſin with ſinne, which thing the ſcripture declareth, and euery Chriſtian confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, becauſe ſinne hath been before in them to deſerue the

As this doctrine of <hi>H.

All the grounde that hee hath of this blaſphemous doctrine, is a blinde, ignoraunt, and altogether vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deſcanting about the names of men, wherein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the deapth of all his diuinitie. For when once hee hath with allegories, as it were with hot irons, ſeared the word, taking away thereby the life and natural ſence of the ſame, then beginneth he to rattle the drie bones, and to deſcant vpon bare names as beſt liketh himſelfe, without anie helpe at all giuen vnto his interpretation, from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place &amp; matter that is inhande, reſting onely, vpon a childiſh &amp; ridiculous deriuation of the words from the Hebrues. For becauſe (as hee ſaieth in that chapter,) <hi>Galilie ſignifieth a turning either winding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi> He will haue this doctrine eſtabliſhed therevpon, that the procreating of the true ſeede, turned it ſelfe about, to witte, that the holie and true ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which (according to his doctrine) all he faithful are, ſhoulde not from thencefoorth, be conceaued of the fleſh, but of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt.

For if he haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto regeneration, Who is ignorant, that the worke therof not onely ſince Chriſt but before his comming, hath beene alwayes wrought through the holie Ghoſt, and neuer performed by fleſhe.

Doeth hee reſt before the glad tidinges of peace, and the glad tidinges of good thinges be heard of, by that Meſſenger whoſe feete bee full of beautie, and whoſe comming is moſt acceptable? Hee driueth fayth from ignoraunce and blinde deuotion, vnto the hearing of the woorde, and yet findeth no perfect reſt there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gladde and good tidinges thereof bee made knowne and aſſured vnto the faythfull.

<pb facs="tcp:8542:40"/>
conceiue that it is no other viſitation he meaneth here, then ſuch as his beſt children, after their offences are forced often to feale at his handes. I meane not (as the Church of Rome woulde haue it) that the Lord doeth thus wreake his wrath vppon them, vntill they ſhall haue made a iuſt ſatiſfaction for their ſinnes: but that hee doeth herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that himſelfe might receiue no ſtaine by them, While albeit hee bee content to bee mercifull vnto them in their ſinne, yet will hee reſerue for all that vnto himſelfe the right of a fatherly viſitation, to declare that he is farre from being a fauourer or friende vnto ſinne. In this explanation of <hi>H.N.</hi> his fayth, wee heare nothing why vnto GOD there ſhoulde bee added this worde [father] and yet it were requiſite ſince hee is called in queſtion for his fayth, by all Chriſtian Churches planted thorowe out the whole worlde, hee ſhoulde ſpeake plainely to euerie principall poynt, yea or no, touching his agreeing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from them. The cauſe of his ſilence herein, is for that hee acknowledgeth no diſtinction of perſons to be in the Godhead, wheras of purpoſe this worde [father] is ſet downe in the Creede and Articles of our fayth, to meete with that miſchiefe of <hi>H.N.</hi> and others, the like their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſies. It had beene requiſite likewiſe, ſince in ſo ſhort a draught of Chriſtianitie, we may not thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing to bee ſuperfluous or vnneceſſarie, that hee had ſhewed ſome good helpe for the ſtrengthening of our fayth to haue come from that almightie power, which the Almightie ſhewed in the workemanſhip of heauen and earth, whereof there is expreſſe mention made to that ende in this place.

that he did not doubt of the promiſe thorow vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, but was ſtrong in faith, becauſe he was well aſſured,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> that hee which had promiſed, was of ſufficient power and abilitie to doe it. And vndoubtedly, when we ſhal vnto anie promiſe of the Lorde, ioyne in ſerious &amp; earneſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this remembraunce withall, that it is the promiſe of that God, who by his power out of nothing, brought all the faire furniture of this world: it cannot but be forcible, to keepe off ſuch doubtes of hauing the promiſes of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as fleſhe and blood are full of. Good reaſon it is therefore, that <hi>H N.</hi> ſhould not haue beene altogither ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in a matter of ſo great importance, but of that wee heare nothing. There is another matter that he ſhooteth at, to wit: after he hath affirmed God to bee a true being, to proue that the ſame being is god the fathers name, &amp; his loue it ſelf, for they are his very words. Now he bringeth no other proufe of it, then that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where it is ſayde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>That God is loue,</hi> but no woorde heard that his being ſhoulde be no other thing beſide loue it ſelfe, which is the matter that he woulde willingly eſtabliſh. Now this is his accuſtomed craftie and ſubtile dealing, the ſooner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the ſimple thereby, hee will aduouche Scripture, when hee ſetteth downe moſt abſurde thinges, albeit there bee no parte of his opinion eſtabliſhed thereby, It ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him if there bee founde in the Scripture one of thoſe woordes that hee vſeth, howe farre ſoeuer hee ſwarue in ſenſe and meaning from the purpoſe of that place from whence hee taketh it. For what reaſon is there in this, to ſay, becauſe GOD is loue, therefore his eſſence and beeing is loue. Shall euerie thing that a man is, become an eſſence and beeing vnto him? One man is religious, riche, learned, well fauoured, temperate, chaſte, humble, charitable: yet are not all theſe his eſſence and beeing. For one thing cannot haue more then one eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And in trueth none of theſe can be called the eſſence
<pb facs="tcp:8542:41"/>
and being of a man, for there bee men that want all theſe, and yet haue the eſſence, being, and nature of men. Nowe albeit the Almightie cannot bee without loue, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followeth not that his being is loue, no more then it doth to ſay, fire cannot be without ſmoke, nor ſnow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whiteneſſe, therefore the eſſence, and naturall being of fire, is ſmoke, and the ſubſtancial nature and being of ſnow is whiteneſſe, which is well knowne to bee moſt vntrue. Moreouer, mercie, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſtrength, and holines, al theſe be as neare the nature &amp; being of the Lord as is loue, for as he is loue, ſo is he wiſdome, righteouſnes, holines &amp; ſtrength, &amp; all theſe are abſolute &amp; perfect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But if all theſe ſeuerally ſhould be his eſſence &amp; being, then ſhould there be many beings &amp; natural eſſences of one thing, nay diſtinct natures &amp; beings of the ſame thing, then the which, what can be more mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous? For the Lord God is but one in eſſence &amp; being, howſoeuer he be three in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therfore this aſſertion of <hi>H.N,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, which being graunted, do neceſſarily inferre that the Lorde God is not one in nature and being, are daungerous, nay hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and blaſphemous. It is no new thing to haue ſuch ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proofes from him, for ſuch ſtraunge opinions, for it is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, and general practiſe throughout al his bookes, and therefore it is aſſuredly true, that if his religion were no better ſtayed and vpholden, by the wealth and fatneſſe of ſome in that familie, then it is by authoritie from the Scriptures: the credite thereof woulde haue beene crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with diuerſe of them long before this time. I thinke <hi>H.N.</hi> hath beene his ſcholler, who now of late hath brought to light and taught a kinde of perſwaſion, which he calleth a princely proofe, whereof hee ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Oratione perſuadere, non Regium, ſed Oratorium munus eſſe: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam autem perſuationem in donis, ac muneribus ſitam eſſe oportere. <hi>It beſeemeth not a King but an Oratour, to perſwade by ſpeach, for a King is to perſwade by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8542:41"/>
giftes and rewardes.</hi>
                  </hi> And ſurely <hi>H.N.</hi> his proofes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Princely by rewardes and giftes: as for proofes and perſwaſions from the ſcripture by worde or writing, whatſoeuer ſhew of ſufficiencie bee made that way, yet in truth he is content to let that alone to poore Oratours and the meaner ſort of men, as ouer baſe and beggerly for ſo mightie a perſonage as is himſelfe. Touching the number of authorities that here are brought foorth, this one thing I am well aſſured of, and ſo will euerie man affirme, that ſhall with anie iudgement examine the ſame, that vnleſſe he take ſomething for their ſtanding, other benefit he hath none by them.</p>
               <p>This true eſſence and being of God, which <hi>H.N</hi> calleth his loue, is not according to his doctrine any thing that the Almightie hath proper and peculiar vnto himſelfe, in that he is God: but that which all the faythfull are poſſeſſed of, and that not in ſome little meaſure, but ſo as there dwel, liue, or rule no other thing in all there ſpirite, thoughtes, mind, and ſoule, but alone this true godhead, with his loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being of the vpright loue. For theſe are his owne words in his firſt exhortation. <hi>Chap. 15.</hi> and <hi>Section. 26. <hi>The true freedome verily is this, that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the gracious word, is wholy releaſed, &amp; purged or purified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all wicked nature, which hath raigned ouer him, &amp; that there dwel, liue, nor rule any other thing in him (namely in al his ſpirit, thoughts, mind &amp; ſoule) but alone the true godhed, with his louely being of the vpright loue, yea to be ſo wholy repleniſhed with all vertues of God, that there flow nothing in him, but the ſpirituall heauenly and liuing waters.</hi>
                  </hi> And becauſe <hi>H.N.</hi> his doctrine tendeth to eſtabliſh a kinde of loue, which in his opinion is the true beeing, diuinitie and deitie of God: therefore he calleth alſo his counſell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, this true being.

So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his doctrine God the father bringeth vs, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then by the hand of our owne obedience, vnto the loue of Ieſus Chriſt.

                  </hi>) to an incorparating in the godlie righteouſneſſe, which is this loue, &amp; the walking therein. Theſe ſundry <hi>Sections</hi> cannot in number compare with the errours therin contained. For firſt in this his diſcourſe vpon the Articles of our belief, where hee was to intreate of faith, he is wholie occupyed about loue, and obedience vnto the law of God. So that faith is nothing but deeds in his opinion: Loue is beliefe: beleeuing is working: and louing or working, is become beleeuing. For he will haue our woorkes and obedience vnto the lawe to get and giue vnto vs the name of beleeuers, that in ſo doing we may be accounted faithfull, and that the ſame ſhould not be a fruite of faith, but faith it ſelf. So that by <hi>H N.</hi> his myſtical doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, a riddel darker then was that which <hi>Sampſon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> is put forth vnto vs: to witte, howe the ſonne ſhould beget the father, &amp; afterwarde they two make but one man.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8542:44"/>
they growe to be but one and the ſame thing.

                  <hi>I</hi> Haue ſufficiently before declared, that Chriſtians are taught to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that it is not enough for them to confeſſe, that there is a Chriſte, or that Chriſt, is the ſonne of the liuing God. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>H. N.</hi> vſually in explaning the articles of our beliefe, ſhunneth as rockes all words of faith and beliefe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſeth in ſteede thereof, woordes of confeſſing, whereof he hath as it ſeemeth conceiued ſome better liking, but the cauſe thereof he is content to keepe ſecrete to him ſelfe. Where he profeſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt is the very like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the liuing GOD his father, and that GOD the father through him hath made and accompliſhed all his woorkes, that he beareth all things with the worde of his power, and hath made the purging of our ſinnes throwe himſelfe: It ſhall (God willing) appeare hereafter in my anſweare vnto this reaſon, that he meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe touching Chriſt, then that his woordes ſeeme at the firſt ſight to giue out of him. As for his reaſon, which is, that becauſe GOD the father hath made, and accompliſhed all his woorkes by Ieſus Chriſt, in the creation of the worlde, therefore hee ſhoulde make the purging of our ſinnes through him ſelfe alone: if it were good and ſufficient, the holie Ghoſte might aſwell haue the name of the mediatour and redeemer, as Ieſus Chriſt. For GOD the father accompliſhed not that woorke without him.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.2.</note> Moreouer howe abſurde is it, that his dealing in the creation, ſhoulde charge
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8542:47"/>
him with the woorke of our redemption? When did <hi>H. N.</hi> euer ſee the obligation, whereby at his entring vppon the Creation, hee ſtoode bounde to perfourme the woorke of redemption? The Scripture telleth vs, hee laide downe his life frankly and freely of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, not to diſcharge any dutie or debt of his owne, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon any former couenant hee had made for him ſelfe to perfourme: but that it was to acquite vs thereby from euerlaſting death and deſtruction, which otherwiſe was in iuſtice to fall vppon vs. And for that cauſe hath he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him this name Ieſus, as we reade in the Goſpel after S. <hi>Matthewe. Thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>for he ſhal ſaue his people from their ſinnes.</hi> He came not then to rid him ſelfe from the daunger, that any former couenant, tharge or duetie of his owne, had laide vpon him or bound him vnto: but to deliuer his people from their ſinnes, which had laide holde vpon them, and as an heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den did preſſe them downe vnto death. So that the reaſon rendred in the ſcriptures why he had to name Ieſus, doth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare that it was no priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his owne, but the ſaluation of his people that was ſought for and accompliſhed by him. And that wee ſhoulde not doubt of his authoritie or abilitie, to goe through with ſo great a matter as is the worke of our ſaluation, therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he from God the father with ſpeciall authoritie, and graces in all abundance annointed and enabled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. And thereuppon hath this name [Chriſt] accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in our tongue ſignifieth [annointed,] that our faith might not roaue vncertainely about our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but directly looke at one both ſufficiently authorized, and alſo fully furniſhed for that woorke, where wee might particularly and cleerely ſee the grounde of al this good will betweene GOD the father and vs. For from hence had this league the beginning, and here is the
<pb facs="tcp:8542:48"/>
hope and aſſurance that wee haue for the continuaunce of it. Wherein the Lord his dealing is in all mercy towards vs, that we ſhould haue ſuch ſpecialtie geuen vs, as might put out of doubt and point foorth particularly the occaſion of our ſaluation. For the ſcripture which is our euidence, doeth not barely mention this matter of our ſaluation, but telleth vs at large, by whom, &amp; at what time it was purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs, what price was paid for it, what enimies ſtoode againſt it, and howe great a woorke it was after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to goe thorowe with it, and that Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did execute both the office of a Prieſt, and alſo of a Prophet in the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing therof, not onely praying for vs in that he was a Prieſt, as appeareth in the Goſpel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>

In which two pointes of offering praier &amp; ſacrifice to God for the people, did the Prieſt his office conſiſt. Wherein the comfort of a Chriſtian is exceeding great, for that he hath ſo ſingular a perſon, the force &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of whoſe prayer and ſacrifice, is dayly in God his ſight for him,<note place="margin">Hebrues. 9.24</note> as it is written to the Hebrues: <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places, made with handes, but into very heauen to appeare nowe in the ſight of God for vs.</hi>

                  <hi>and is his onely begotten ſonne,</hi> and therefore not onely of all other moſt deare vnto him, but alſo moſt priuie vnto his greateſt ſecretes. For which cauſe hee is called by the Prophet <hi>Counſellour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 9.6</note> And in as much as his kingdome wherin ſhould dwel holines and righteouſneſſe, was to be gouerned by the ſcepter of his worde and preaching of the Goſpel: he hath promiſed his preſence euen to the ende of the worlde, vnto that office and function:<note place="margin">Math. 28.19</note> 
                  <hi>Goe therefore and teache all nations, to obſerue what ſo euer I haue commaunded you, and loe I am with you vnto the end of the worlde.</hi> For by vertue of this function, he hath not onely barely and nakedly to ſet downe a trueth vnto vs, but alſo to woorke effectually with it, to tranſfourme vs into the ſame, that we might geue credite to the promiſes and be humbled vnto the dueties commaunded. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that commeth vnto a chriſtian, for that Chriſt is made our teacher and Prophet is likewiſe very great, for who can make vs doubt or make any queſtion of it, howe wee ſhould knowe the wil of God generally, or his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the beleuer perticularly, when the ſonne himſelfe, to whom (as being neereſt vnto him) the wil of the father is wholy and altogeather made knowen, hath opened the ſame in his Goſpel? Who dare nowe tell me, that as one who hath no iudgement or diſcretion, I am wholy to put ouer my ſelfe in matters of fayth, to Councelles, fathers, and conſent of nations: when I am taught too beleeue that Chriſte Ieſus is annointed Prophet and Teacher: aſwell inwardly to perſwade by his ſpirite, as outwardly to teache and ſet downe a true rule of righteouſneſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is written in <hi>Iohn.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:8542:49"/>
from him that is holy, and know al things.</hi> Theſe things touching his name and office I haue vttered more at large, becauſe <hi>H.N.</hi> with one breath paſſeth from the creation of all thinges by Chriſt, vnto the woorke of our redemption, as if they had not onely both one workeman, but alſo were both of them nothing els but one &amp; the ſame worke, nay which more is, as if the comming of Chriſt in the fleſhe, and his ſuffering, had been onely to anſweare a duety, that was laid vpon him by ſome couenant from the creation, which ſtoode him ſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anſwere for his own benefite, whereas the Scripture laieth out at large, the matter of our ſaluation, as the moſt ſpeciall and principall thing that it handleth. A thing ſo ſeueral and ſundred from the creation, as that the ſonne of God hath not onely nowe another matter in hande, but alſo a newe name, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, a diuerſe office, and a diſtinct condition. <hi>H.N.</hi> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al theſe good words, is not of opinion that Ieſus Chriſt is God, for then here eſpecially he woulde haue beene plaine, and laide out the matter at large, not onely for that neceſſarie occaſion is offered him, by the mention that is made of the onely ſonne of God: but alſo becauſe our redemption, which is the matter he hath in hand, could not be accompliſhed by any that was but man onely. For what iuſt ſatiſfaction coulde a mortall man make, for offences committed agaynſt the high maieſtie of GOD, when offences growe to be greater or leſſe, as the partie offended is in place and dignitie higher or lower? According as wee ſee that an euill woorde ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt a Prince, hath in iuſtice greater puniſhment, then the ſame woorde ought to haue, being ſpoken but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a priuate man. Nowe when ſo great a perſon as the only begotten ſonne of GOD, and GOD him ſelfe, hath humbled him ſelfe in our nature for vs, and beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient euen vnto that moſt ſlaunderous death of the croſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8542:49"/>
for our cauſe, no man can deny, but that ſuche a ſacrifice is able to weigh with all the ſinnes of his ſeruauntes. For that obedience hath eſtimation and deſert from the perſon who did perfourme it.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.15</note> Howe daungerouſly then dealeth this Familie as much as in them lieth, to ſhake out faith, beſide the iniurie that they doe offer vnto his Maieſtie, when they deny the Godhead of Chriſt: ſeeing no man is able to bring that price, wherewith ſinne may be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as anſwered in deſert, and our conſciences reſt vpon, as in a ſufficient diſcharge againſt the ſame. Moreouer who not beeing the Almighty him ſelfe, had beene able to preuayle againſt death, and to breake through the iron barres, and mightie chaines of the graue, which yet is but the priſon of the body onely, and not that darkeſt dungeon and ſafeſt ward that Sathan hath, where the ſoule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, when ſinne ceaſeth vpon the conſcience? Nowe the gates of both theſe priſons were to be opened, and that ſo wide, as infinite multitudes beſide him ſelfe, might ſafely paſſe thorowe them nay they were to bee broken vnto ſo ſmall ſheuers, as it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiible euer after to make them of ſtrength able, to bee kept ſhut againſt the feebleſt of his ſeruauntes. But I knowe you are deſirous out of <hi>H. N.</hi> his bookes, to knowe what hee thinketh of Chriſte, ſeeing I doe ſo conſtantly affirme that hee denieth him to bee GOD, and haue before referred you for your further ſatiſfaction touching his opinion heerein, vnto this place, and likewiſe what you may ſafely ſay by warraunt from his owne writings, that he beleueth Chriſt to be. By the doctrine of <hi>H.N.</hi> Chriſt is no one man, but an eſtate and condition in men, common to ſo many, as haue receiued his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that they are growen thereby to perfection, &amp; nowe ſinne no more. Which eſtate hee calleth the true light, or true beeing and perfection. For proofe whereof, I
<pb facs="tcp:8542:50"/>
referre you vnto the xiii. Chapter of his <hi>Euangelie</hi> or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſage of the kingdome, towarde the ende of ſecond <hi>ſection</hi> there hee hath theſe wordes. <hi>This ſame true light, is the annointed with the holy ghoſt, which annointed in Hebrue, is named <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in Greeke <hi>Chriſtus.</hi> Hee was alſo in times paſt, called of certaine Rabbins amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, the Lorde his Sabboth.

For the ſame annointed which commeth at that time out of heauen, with his annointing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the ſpirite, and is the very like being of the godhead it ſelf, he is a Prieſt of the moſt higheſt, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and greater of dignitie then was Aaron, becauſe hee bideth euerlaſtingly, and is a miniſter of the ſpiritual &amp; heauenly goodes.</hi> This ſame true light which <hi>H.

thus. <hi>Oh alas, how groſly haue then certaine wiſe of the world, and Scripture learned ouerreached them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which haue without diuerſitie forſaken the lawe and the ſeruice of the elders Teſtament, and of the Prieſtes office after the ordinance of Aaron, and ſet backe the ſame as a thing vnneedefull, not once diſtincting, vnto whom the ſeruice after the ordinaunce of Aaron is yet neceſſary, nor yet with whom the ſame at the appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time ceaſeth or leaueth of, but haue al for the moſt parte cried Chriſt, Chriſt, and we are Chriſtians, and attributed to themſelues much freedome, ere euer the time of the appearing of Chriſt, or the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the holy Ghoſt was come to paſſe, or fulfilled with them in the accompliſhing of the olde Teſtament. Oh that they yet nowe awaked, and tooke heede in the woorde of the ſeruice of loue, vnto this grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, and gaue eare vnto the ſame, that they might vnderſtande their ſafemaking, and ſo then bee rightly and according to the trueth, brought to the true beyng, that is vnto Chriſt.</hi> You heare that hee complayneth greately of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture learned, that they haue altogether and generally leaſte the Leuiticall Prieſſhoode, and ſeruice after the ordinaunce of <hi>Aaron,</hi> forbidding it vnto all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, when as the time of the appearing of Chriſt is not yet come to paſſe with many, becauſe they haue not taken heede in the woorde of the ſeruice of loue, vnto this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, and therefore hee wiſheth in the tenth <hi>Section,</hi> that they yet woulde nowe awake, and take heede in the woorde of the ſeruice of loue, vnto this gratious time, that ſo they might rightly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the trueth bee brought to the true beyng, that is as he ſaieth vnto Chriſt: for theſe be his owne woordes in this place: <hi>And ſo then be rightly and according to the

truth brought vnto the true beeing, that is vnto Chriſt.</hi> So that nowe you ſee clerely by receiuing effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually this his doctrine, men are made that true light, whereof he ſpake before in this chapter, when as he ſaide: <hi>And this ſame true light is the annoynted with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which is named in Hebrue Meſſias, and in Greeke Chriſtus.</hi> In the ſixth <hi>Section,</hi> hee declareth when men may be ſaide to come to this true being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he calleth Chriſt.

                  </hi> in theſe woordes, <hi>Wee confeſſe that no man can become partaker with all the holy ones of God,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:53"/>
of the reſurrection of Chriſt, but ſuche as indeuour themſelues in the beliefe, vnder the obedience of the loue of Ieſu, to become implanted into Chriſt, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious worde of the Lorde, and euen ſo then to die with Chriſt, in his like death, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt and the gratious worde of the Lorde, which is <hi>H. N.</hi> his doctrine, are heere vnited by him, and made one and the ſame thing, which thing not onely the ſenſe will leade you vnto, but alſo the manner of poynting, which hath no litle myſtery in it. For after [Chriſt] ye ſhall finde in his booke a full &amp; perfect point, albeit the ſenſe be yet hanging, aboue the head of it, there is an other point reaching forward, which is a priuie marke betweene him &amp; his diſciples, telling them that the woorde following doth open and expounde it, After [the gratious woorde of the Lorde.] Yee ſee an other full and perfect point, and aboue the heade of it, a point looking backewarde, to inſinuate vnto them that the woorde behinde, doeth in like manner open and declare it. There is not one iodde in <hi>H.N.</hi> his Goſpell, that goeth for nothing. For euen this Childiſhe toy, is made a myſterie, nay a miracle with manie of them. Nowe whenſoeuer <hi>H.N.</hi> vſeth this forme of ſpeache, <hi>[by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſt.]</hi> Hee meaneth eyther this ſtate of perfection, or elſe this gratious woorde of his, wherein the ſence will direct vs whether of the interpretations wee are to admitte off. The like is to bee ſayde of this forme of woordes [in Ieſu Chriſte:] that is in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which his illuminate Elders doe euioy, or in the gratious doctrine, which hee hath brought into the worlde. Chriſt then is nothing elſe but annointed, and (as ye haue hearde) by his allegoricall expoſition is geuen to all that are come to that infection (he calleth it <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) which was ſpoken of before,<note place="margin">H. N. his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</note> to wit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done with <hi>Aaron</hi> and the ſeruiceable word, and haue met with their <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who doth all to berubbe their heades
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8542:53"/>
with reuelations, and as for their conuerſation, telleth them whatſoeuer their doinges be, they are no longer now to be ſaid or accompted to haue any ſinne in them. Now to colour his doings, he ſpeaketh of al the vpright children of the beliefe, that are thus annointed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſingular number, as of one bodie, that his young diſciples ſhould not ſmel out his hereſie at the firſt: but remaine ſtill of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that when he ſpeaketh of Chriſt, hee meaneth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſide that ſame one perſon, whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh, which is both God and man: Whereas in truth he comprehendeth vnder that name, all that multitude or number howe many ſoeuer, who haue to diet, from <hi>H.N.</hi> this roſte meate of reuelations. It appeareth by this whiche hathe beene ſayde,<note place="margin">Chriſt is not God.</note> that <hi>H.N.</hi> his Chriſt is not GOD, but an affection or diſpoſition in man, which if it were good, were yet no more but godlineſſe, not GOD himſelfe. But wee haue hearde manifeſtly prooued vnto vs before, that of neceſſitie the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and redeemer of man, muſt be GOD himſelfe. And therefore this miſerable man, pulleth vppe the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our ſaluation by the rootes. His doctrine of Chriſt is declared yet more playnely, if poſſibly that may be, in that allegory which he maketh of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the nienth Chapter of his Euangelie. Where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that the righteouſneſſe of the Lawe, with the great knowledge of the fleſhe, or of the earthly being, which is borne out of the letter, and hath to name <hi>Adam, Eſau</hi> or <hi>Edom:</hi> muſt ſerue the little ſingle minded ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, which is borne out of the ſpirite or heauenly being. He affirmeth in the <hi>8. <hi>Section</hi>
                  </hi> of that chapter, That thoſe, who liue vnder the obedience of loue, that is his family, doe openly perceiue theſe two birthes in themſelues. The firſt birth is, when we vnderſtande the worde according to the letter, and are reaching or ſtriuing to atteine to the perfection which his illuminated elders are poſſeſſed of.
<pb facs="tcp:8542:54"/>
And this birth hee calleth in this <hi>Section, <hi>The right knowledge of man out of the fleſhe or letter, the ſeede that is borne according to the fleſhe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Adam and Chriſt after the flesh are one with H.N.</note> 
                     <hi>and hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the promiſes.</hi>
                  </hi> And in the tenth <hi>Section</hi> hee calleth it <hi>the minde of the fleſhe, which is named Adam, Eſau, or Edo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh.</hi> The ſecond borne, as he affirmeth in the eleuenth <hi>Section,</hi> holdeth himſelfe in ſtilneſſe, and obteyneth through the prudence of the holy Ghoſt, the bleſſing of the promiſes. In the nienth <hi>Section,</hi> he calleth it the <hi>Godhead, the truth. Gods true being it ſelfe,<note place="margin">H.N. calleth the ſeconde birth, Chriſt, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, &amp; Gods true being it ſelf.</note> the inheritaunce of all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and heauenly goodes, the true ſeede of the beliefe, that becommeth borne in vs according to the ſpirite &amp; inheriteth the promiſes of God the Father.</hi> And in the twelfth <hi>Section</hi> and laſt line thereof hee calleth it Chriſt, theſe be his woordes: <hi>The ſeconde birth, which is not minded according to the fleſhe, but according to the ſpirite of the heauenly trueth, obteineth the victorie, beareth rule with God, and bringeth foorth the name of Iſrael or Chriſt it ſelfe.</hi> By this which hath bene ſaide it appeareth euidently, that <hi>H.N.</hi> his Chriſt, is that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man or men, which liueth as it beſt liketh, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng nowe any more vnder the gouernement of the written woorde, which he calleth the ſeruiceable letter, hauing let the rayne looſe vnto reuelations, ſo that nothing ſhall now be good, but that he thinketh to be good, neither ſhall any thing be euill of it ſelfe, vnleſſe he iudge it to be euill. For he is now the rule himſelf, to make by his reuelation what conſtruction ſoeuer he will of the worde, ſo it be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter and naturall ſence of the ſame, for that is with him the firſt borne, which cannot inherite the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. It ſhall now be now be no great hard matter by the light wee haue had from theſe former places, to finde out the poyſon that lyeth vnder the ſweete wordes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he geueth Chriſt in his confeſſion. For confeſſing Chriſt to bee the very like
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8542:54"/>
beeing of God his Father, wee may ſoone perceiue what he meaneth, when hee calleth the ſeconde birh (wherof ſo many be partakers as ſhall inherit the promiſes <hi>Gods true being it ſelfe, &amp; the very like being of the Godhed it ſelf,</hi> which are his owne words, in the xiii. chapter of his Goſpel and fifth <hi>Section.</hi> Confeſſing likewiſe that God the Father, by Chriſt hath made and accompliſhed all his woorke, what is this more, then that he attributeth in the xiii.

For ſeeing by man, and in our nature, ſinne was committed, and corruption did take beginning: the iuſtice of God did require, that he ſhould be very man, and haue our nature, who was to make ſatiſfaction for the ſame. That as equitie doth require, where the offence was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there the ſatiſfaction might be made. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe howe coulde our conſciences reſt ſatiſfyed, that the law in iuſtice were anſweared, and for this cauſe the holie Ghoſt ſaith: <hi>He toke not on him the nature of Angels, but the nature of men, and the ſeede of Abraham.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> And therefore in that he refuſing the nature of Angels, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him the nature of man, hee hath in ſo doing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen all <hi>H.N.</hi> his ſpiritual conſtructions, and ſuperce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſticall interpretations, touching the fleſh and humanitie of Chriſt: and forceth him to a true and naturall meaning in that matter. It was neceſſary likewiſe for our comfort, that his conception ſhould be pure, and therefore that hee ſhould be borne of a virgine, without the help of man. For otherwiſe, if hee had not beene pure in and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, he had beene no meete Mediatour for others, but one that had ſtoode in neede of a Mediatour him ſelf. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould the ſatiſfaction make our full and perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge againſt the iuſtice of God ſeeing his beſt children, are not rid of the remnaunts of ſinne, but ſtil feele prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and motions vnto euill in them: if our nature in him, who is the peacemaker, were not pure, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

For according to this doctrine, when once we haue ceaſed to ſinne, ſinne likewiſe ceaſeth to lay anie thing to our charge, and thus this obedience beareth our ſinnes in vs. This doctrine is confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> in his <hi>53.</hi> Chapter, (if we will beleeue <hi>H.N.</hi>) for that place is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him for it.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.9.</note> where he ſetteth the righteoſneſſe of one man, for the making of many righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, againſt the diſobedience of one, vnto the making of manie ſinners. Can the righteouſneſſe of one man make manie righteous if this doctrine of <hi>H.N.</hi> be true, that our ſinnes are borne in our ſelues, and our righteouſneſſe not layde vp in another for vs, but reſteth in our owne breaſtes within vs? In the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> the Apoſtle doeth yet more plainly declare himſelfe to haue a contrarie ſpirite to <hi>H.N.</hi> in that hee is flatte contrarie in ſpeach. For he affirmeth Chriſt, to be a ſinner in vs, and vs to be righteous in him: our ſinnes to be imputed vnto him, and his righteouſneſſe to be reckoned ours: our ſinnes to be borne in him, and ſo he to be made ſinne for vs: and we righteouſneſſe in him.<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>For he made him to bee ſinne for vs,</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>which knewe no ſinne, that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> If he be made ſinne for vs, then are not our ſinnes borne in vs, if we be righteous before God, or the righteouſnes of God in him: then not in vs, but in him, are our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both borne and buried, and our righteouſneſſe wholie and altogither purchaſed.

The ſuffering of this Chriſt, &amp; his death of the croſſe, is ſet forth in this, that he hath yelded all obedience to the worde of his heauenly father, which is this doctrine of <hi>H.N.</hi> and gone vnder and borne reproch, blaſphemie, contempt, and falſe defamation or accuſation for the ſame.

Hee hath prooued that Chriſte was woorthie of his death, and coulde not haue come to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ioy, if hee had not died in the fleſhe, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that Iudas and the high Prieſtes, did a verie good woorke vnto Chriſt himſelfe, in putting him to that death: that the Croſſe was a bleſſed thing, and the death thereof a bleſſed death for Chriſte himſelfe: that Iudas and the Iewes, were bleſſed men in that woorke of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt his death: and that his life and eſtate before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that time, for his owne good and benefite, did neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require the ſame: that the life of Iudas and the Iewes that crucified Chriſt, was better then the life of Chriſt: and their eſtate in al reſpectes better then his: that they walked in the wayes of life, and hee in the wayes of death: that they who wiſhed and procured his death were his beſt friends:

and his mother and diſciples who ſtoode agaynſt it, and councelled him otherwiſe, were his greateſt enimies,<note place="margin">By the doctrine of H.N.

Neyther can any paſſe into immortalitie, but by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and killing of him, and therefore one of theſe cannot bee ſo muche as a tipe or figure of an other, muche leſſe the thing it ſelfe.

And the Diſciple likewiſe who wounded the ſeruant of the high Prieſt with his ſworde, receiued a reproofe from Chriſt with this anſweare, That he might with a worde haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned armies of Angelles from heauen in his defence, but that it might not be otherwiſe, for then the ſcriptures ſhoulde not haue beene fulfilled. This declareth that the true Chriſt was ſubiect to externall force and apprehended, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was willing to die to fulfil the Scriptures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwiſe he might haue had legions of Angels in his quarrell, and therefore that Mathematicall Chriſt, who ſuffereth in wardly in the minde of man, a departure out of the letter into the ſpirtie hath no reſemblaunce with this Chriſt which is here ſet foorth in the Scriptures. When this true Chriſt his paſſion and ſuffering is in hande, it is declared particularly and playnely howe the Scriptures which foretolde that matter, and the manner of it alſo, are verified in him who accompliſhed all that trueth which they foretolde, and therefore can not the hyſtorie of him, bee a foretelling or ſhadowing out of a truth, yet to bee performed by <hi>H.N.</hi> or any other their doctrine or doinges whatſoeuer.

For the death of Chriſt vppon the Croſſe, was a ſacrifice for our ſinne, of that excellencie, that it coulde not be imitated of any man, and of that ſufficiencie, that it needed not by imitation to be reiterated. According as we reade in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues, in theſe words: <hi>Such an high Prieſt it became vs to haue, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmeleſſe, vndefiled, ſeperate from ſinners,</hi>

This doctrine is <hi>H.N.</hi> and his family vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of; they ſee no reaſon why the ſacrifice and obedience of one man, ſhoulde diſcharge and aunſweare for the ſinnes of an other, and therefore ſaith <hi>H.N.</hi> in this place,<note place="margin">Mortification is our iuſtification according to the doctrine of H.N.</note> that we likewiſe ſhoulde followe Chriſte in the death of his Croſſe, to the ſafemaking of vs from our ſinnes: when notwithſtanding in playne woordes it is written, that wee are ſanctified by the once offering of the bodie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.110</note> Where it is playnely prooued that the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnder the law were therefore conuict of imperfection,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:66"/>
and made vnable to ſatiſfie for ſinne: becauſe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated, and yeare by yeare offered. For as it is written in that Chapter: <hi>If the ſacrifices vnder the lawe had ſanctified the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers therunto, they woulde then haue ceaſſed to haue bene offered: for where remiſſion is of ſinne, there is no more offering for ſinne, &amp; they being once purged, ſhoulde haue had no more conſcience of ſinnes.</hi> So that by the reaſon of the holy Ghoſt in this place, there is no remiſſion of ſinne to bee looked for, by the ſuffering and death of <hi>H. N.</hi> his Chriſt, becauſe it is often renewed and continually reiterated. For euery one of that familie, is to ſuffer with Chriſt the like death of the Croſſe. And as the true ſacrifice for ſinne was but one, to declare the ſufficiencie and perfection thereof: ſo the true Sacrificer for ſinne, to argue his abilitie, had none to take his place after him in that worke, in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt hath the prerogatiue aboue the Prieſts vnder the lawe, who becauſe they could not liue alwayes, had others to ſucceede them in that function: Wheras he enduring for euer hath the office for euer remaining to himſelf alone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written to the Hebrues:<note place="margin">Heb. 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>And among them</hi> (ſpeaking of the Prieſtes, vnder the law) <hi>many were made Prieſtes, becauſe they were not ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure by reaſon of death. But this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth euer, hath a Prieſthood which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not paſſe from one vnto another.</hi> Whereby it appeareth playnely, that the true Chriſt can haue none to follow him, eyther in the office, or in the offering for ſinne. And therfore this doctrine of <hi>H.

For the wages that are growing vnto vs for our woorkes are called due debt, and claymed in equitie by iuſt title, and when they ſhall truely pay them, yet is that no more but duetie which proceedeth from them: But fauour and and friendſhip ruled in the matter, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified, becauſe the ſcripture (ſaith he) was accepted or reckoned righteous, bringing nothing with him beſide faith, that is a reſting in the gracious good will of God, whereof he had a merciful promiſe and graunt made vnto him. Likewiſe when <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſinnes were not imputed neither laid vnto his charge, that was fauour in the Lord pardoning them, and not imputing them vnto him. Howe doeth this hang togeather with the doctrine of <hi>H. N.</hi> who ſaith, that wee are to folowe Chriſt in the death of his croſſe, to the pardoning &amp; releaſing of vs from our ſinnes? And howe will this folowing of Chriſt in his death of the croſſe, for the ſafe making of vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſinnes, ſtand with this not imputing of our ſinnes vnto vs? For if our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes ſtande by imputation, then is it not purchaſed by imitation and following of Chriſte in his like death and ſuffering. If Chriſt his ſatiſfaction for ſinne, ſtande bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

the wrath of GOD and vs, then doeth not our imitation of Chriſt in his death, keepe of the daunger of our ſinnes from vs. The Braſen Serpent erected in the wilderneſſe at the commaundement of Almightie God, which was a figure of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Num 21. g.</note> declareth that it is faith in him that did hang vppon the croſſe, and not the following after him in the death of the croſſe, that doeth iuſtifie vs, and keepe the ſting of our ſinnes from beeing deadly vnto vs. For thoſe who are bitten with the liuing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes, were promiſed if they ſhoulde looke vppon the dead Serpent, to liue and recouer by that meanes, but were not inioyned, to haue them ſelues after death erected and ſet vppe vppon a Pole, for their recouery from that daunger. As appeareth in the booke of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi> And the Lord ſaide vnto <hi>Moſes. Make thee a fiery Serpent; and ſet it vppe for a ſigne, that as many as are bitten may looke vppon it, and liue:</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> made a Serpent of Braſſe, and ſet it vppe for a ſigne, and when a Serpent had bitten a man, then hee looked to the Serpent of Braſſe and liued. Nowe the ſharpe and daungerous biting and ſtingyng of the liuyng Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, did force them to leaue them ſelues, and too looke after comfort where it was to bee founde. And when ſinne ſhal once ſting the fauourers of this opinion of <hi>H. N.</hi> (theyr conſciences beyng awaked which nowe are in a deadly ſleepe) they ſhall then bee forced to feele and confeſſe, that there is no medicine in them ſelues, able to aſſwage the heate and anger thereof. But as it ſeemed vnlikely to fleſhe and blood, that a Serpent of Braſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng but a dead thing, coulde euer woorke a cure vppon them, who were ſtoong with quicke &amp; liuing Serpentes, and in daunger of preſent death, eſpecially by the looking and beholding of the ſame: So doeth it vnto <hi>H.

Chriſte his obedience vppon the croſſe, beeyng but looked vppon with the eies of our faith, and not imitated in the ſelfe ſame practiſe, ſhoulde bee able to heale the ſores of our ſoule, Albeit our Sauiour Chriſt affirmeth in plaine ſpeache, <hi>That as Moſes lifte vp the Serpent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe ſo muſte the Sonne of man bee lift vp, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhoulde not periſhe, but haue eternall life.</hi> The opinion of <hi>H.

For obedience if it were perfect in vs, and no tranſgreſſion to bee founde againſt the lawe of God, either in thought woorde or deede, after that once wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to feare him, yet coulde not all this anſwere, for the leaſt ſinne that went before. For it is but a part of that is due vnto the Lorde from vs: Who teacheth vs, that when wee ſhall haue diſcharged the whole debt, and haue doone euery thing commaunded: yet are wee humblie to acknowledge, that wee bee but vnprofitable ſeruauntes, and haue doone no more then that which was our dutie to doe, according as hee by our owne experience and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe doth plainely prooue vnto vs. For which of you (ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt) Hauing a ſeruaunt plowyng, or other wyſe labouryng all the day long, wyll by and by,<note place="margin">Luke. 17.7.</note> after hee bee come home, ſay vnto him, Goe and ſit downe at the Table, wyll hee not rather be ready to enioyne him an other woorke within the houſe, as to prepare thynges for his owne Supper, and when that is doone, laye the thirde labour vppon him, as to wayte at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſee nothing to bee wantyng, vntyll hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe haue ſupped: yea and when all this is doone, doeth hee ſo muche as once open his mouth to thanke
<pb facs="tcp:8542:68"/>
that ſeruant, becauſe he did that which was commaunded vnto him, I trowe not, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt. And in very deede, we do looke for ſuch duetie from a ſeruant, that yf he ſhall deny to doe any thing of that which his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall commaunde him, foorthwith wee geue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he is no man meete for ſeruice, becauſe we think that the ſeruant ought not (as if hee weere a free man) to haue any libertie or priuiledge, but to reache in obedience vnto all, that his maiſter by commaundement ſhal enioyne him. And therfore accordingly when our ſeruant ſhal haue diſpatched labour after labour, and obeyed commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement after commaundement, yet do we not once thanke him for all that, becauſe wee thinke it is all duetie that a ſeruant doeth, howe muche ſo euer. Herevpon came that Prouerbe, <hi>That no man can ſerue two maiſters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeruice is voide of all priuiledge and libertie, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite duetie, if maiſters ſhall make no ende of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for all is accompted duetie in a ſeruaunt, which the maiſter ſhall commaunde him to do. A man cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently woonder at the blindneſſe of <hi>H.

Yf they coulde perſwade men, that there were either equitie right or reaſon in this kinde of dealing, which they wil force vpon the Lorde: it were no great matter too growe ſoone as riche in goodes, as they doe take them ſelues to be in godlineſſe. For when they haue long tyme gone vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credit, if after their beginning to pay for wares as they ſhall take them: they coulde perſwade their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that the ſame dealing which nowe at the laſte they haue light vppon, doeth not onely anſwere their former debtes, but alſo in equitie deſerue to haue better penie-worthes alwayes after: howeſoeuer it ſhould fare with their creditours, they were ſure to gaine greatly by it. Thus blinde is man when he walketh without the worde. And when his reaſon for ſome long time hath been his rule, his puniſhment from GOD is ſo great, that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it in the ende to bee reaſon, to depart from all equitie and reaſon. If our ſinnes were anſwered in that obedience wherby our life is reformed, how commeth it then to paſſe that the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> after they were turned from theyr lewde life to ſerue the liuing God, affirmeth: that yf Chriſte be not riſen, they are yet

For thoſe are his very words (as you haue heard) <hi>he ſet himſelfe according to the ſpirit, at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of god his father (in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly being.)</hi> More ouer, he is of opinion, that he is not a true Chriſt, but (as he ſpeaketh &amp; imagineth of him) that is according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For touching this point, theſe are his words, <hi>He after the ſpirit, and according to the trueth of the heauenly Godhed, is an euerlaſting and true Chriſt of God.</hi> And that in this abſurd doctrine, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth might come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and a mingle mangle made of all things, hee ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to affirme that Chriſt is the holy ghoſt, and that the doctrine which is deliuered in the <hi>2.</hi> of the Actes of the Apoſtles touching the holy ghoſt appearing in clouen ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues like fire: was nothing elſe, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appearing of this his Chriſt after the ſpirit. Theſe are his wordes touching this matter:<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt is Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>His diſciples therefore were mindfull of all this, and what he had ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; remained within Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, waiting co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cordably with ſupplication &amp; praier for the promiſes of the father, vntil that chriſt after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appeared vnto them out of the heauenly being.</hi> The ſubtiltie of that ancient enimie vnto mankind, may here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently be ſeene, for albeit heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not further diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, then the meaning of <hi>H.N.</hi> is from the truth of the doctrine ſet forth in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Creede &amp; theſe articles of our belief: yet to colour his craft withall, he keepeth him to the ſame words which the church vſeth: profeſſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſt roſe the third day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, ſaue that he interlaceth ſome odde words, which cannot wel be diſcerned, but by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are well acquainted with his bookes, vnder the which he

conueyeth all his corrupt doctrine. Here hee ſayeth that the God of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> hath rayſed vp [this his ſonne Ieſus] hauing relation in theſe wordes [this his ſonne] vnto that Chriſt which he deſcribeth. And likewiſe when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that Chriſt roſe euen ſo the thirde day from the dead: by this ſpeach <hi>[euen ſo]</hi> hee caryeth vs from the reſurrection in the fleſhe, vnto the riſing in the ſpirite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as himſelfe hath imagined of the matter, and yet is hee content to make mencion of the thirde day, as if there were no ill meaning in the man, when as indeede, this riſing the thirde day, muſt bee euen ſo as hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that is nothing ſo as the truth is. Where the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmeth, that Chriſt appeared in the fleſh after his reſurrection, vnto his diſciples,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.20.</note> and ſhewed vnto them his handes and his ſide: and that hee willed <hi>Thomas,</hi> (who had affirmed he woulde neuer beleeue his reſurrection, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee ſhoulde put his finger into the print of the nayles, and his hande into his ſide) to put his finger where the nayles had beene, and his hande into his ſide:<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.27.</note> 
                  <hi>H.N.</hi> to mainteine his doctrine of the reſurrection in the ſpirite, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that he ſhewed vnto his diſciples, nothing elſe but the victorie ouer ſinne, death, deuil, and hell: as if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them, howe by his ſuffering &amp; paſſion, he came by the victorie ouer ſin, death, the deuil and hell: to the ende they might follow him in the ſame footeſteppes, and ſo become partakers of the like victorie with him. Which thing in plaine woordes hee profeſſeth in the next <hi>Section.</hi> Heere he ſetteth foorth the matter not altogither ſo plainely, and yet clearely enough, to him that is anie thing acquainted with his ſubtile writing, and craftie manner of ſpeaking. Theſe bee his woordes in this place: <hi>Hee appeared or made manifeſt him ſelfe to his friendes, which loued him, ſhewing vnto them thorowe his ſuffering and death of the Croſſe, the victorie ouer the ſinne, death, deuill, hell, the fleſhe,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:73"/>
and the worlde.</hi> What plainer proofe can be brought, not onely that Chriſt did riſe in the fleſhe, but alſo that he roſe in the ſame fleſh wherein he ſuffered, then this euen now alledged out of the Goſpel after ſaint <hi>Iohn:</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſee his handes and his ſide, <hi>Thomas</hi> putteth his finger into the place, where the nayles had beene, and his hande into his ſide, which thing <hi>H.

But wee haue not thus learned Chriſt, ſo manie as haue beene taught out of the woorde of God, the truth of him, and the true fruite of his reſurrection. For as Chriſt Ieſus died in our ſinnes, and went downe into the graue in our iniquities, inaſmuch as it was our ſinnes, and no offence of his owne, that drewe him vnto death: ſo his reſurrection, was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abſolution and clearing of the faithfull, from al their tranſgreſſions. For had one ſinne of his ſeruants bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiſfied for, neither woulde death haue reſigned hir right, who had areſted him as ſuretie for ſinne, neither would the righteous Lord, by raiſing him from the dead, &amp; bringing him out of the danger that he lay vnder for our ſinnes, haue giuen ſentence on his ſide, &amp; ſo iuſtified vs in him. Which thing the apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth, triumphing ouer conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, not onely becauſe we haue diſcharged it by his death: but alſo becauſe we haue our <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> &amp; acquittance to ſhew for the ſame,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> euen his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Who ſhal lay any thing to the charge of god his choſe?

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8542:74"/>
epiſtle to the Corin. affirmeth plainly,<note place="margin">1.

For as God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deliuering Chriſt vnto death, did caſt all our ſinnes vpon him, and condemned our ſinnes in him:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now if the Lorde had let him make an eſcape who was in holde for our ſinnes, inaſmuch as he had once taken vpon hym to ſatiſfie for the ſame, or wrougt his deliuerance and ſet him at libertie, before a ful &amp; ſufficient ſatisfaction had bene made: then coulde not himſelfe haue bene cleared of iniurye offred vnto vs, nor his Iuſtice haue bene vnſpotted euen before vs, which if once wee ſuffer to enter but into our thoughtes, it maketh vs giltye of high treaſon againſt our God.

This is the taking in of the the heauen,<note place="margin">How H.N. his Chriſt hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heauen.</note> or the aſcending into Heauen of <hi>H.N.</hi> his Chriſt, and the ſitting at the right hand of God his father: euen to become heauenly minded, and inſpired from aboue, in all fulneſſe with this knowledge and obedience, which <hi>H.N.</hi> requireth in this his ſeruice of loue. Heere is neither hope nor comfort for vs in any other man beſide our ſelues, neither is any conſolation opened, either from the aſcenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, either elſe for that he ſitteth at the right hande of God his father: only this is confeſſed, that the number of his perfect ones, are become incloſers, and haue taken in the heauen, ſo that there is no portion of heauen and other true happineſſe to be hired, or otherwiſe had, vnleſſe a man renounce the knowledge of the worde after the letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come voyde of all ſinne, and perfectly illuminated with the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cleerenes of <hi>H.N.</hi> his doctrine. The greateſt comfort that I ſee a man (who would willingly become a diſciple) can haue by <hi>H.

When ſhall we once come to the bottom of this dungeon of darkeneſſe? How hard is it, when once a man hath giuen way to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to finde that ſtoppe which ſhall make him ſtay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himſelfe? Howe great is the goodneſſe of our God, that hath armed vs with cleere and plaine doctrine out of his woorde, againſt theſe and the like daungers, and hath left vnto vs, the knowledge of his Chriſt, to our exceeding great comfort and conſolation: inſomuch that euery article
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8542:77"/>
of our beliefe, addeth ſomething to the conſolation of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? For albeit our hope be great, in that we heare of him (who went downe into the graue in our ſinnes) that hee is riſen againe, and ſo acquite of that danger and iudgement, which he lay vnder for the ſame: yet is it much more, when we vnderſtand that the Lord hath not ſo left him and caſte him of, who was the whole dealer &amp; doer for vs: but hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him into heauen, his owne ſeate &amp; habitation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue the arguments &amp; tokens of his loue here had their end, but he hath ſet him on his right hand, that is, hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the whole gouernment &amp; adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome heervpon earth into his hands. How can it goe harde with vs, when our mediatour, and he that hath had all theſe dealings for vs, is become ſo great with our God, as to bee made the head of his church, &amp; to haue receiued the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; charge ouer his choſen? May we not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle triumph &amp; ſay: <hi>Who ſhal lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen: it is Chriſt which is dead, or rather which is riſen again, nay which is at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king interceſſion for vs?</hi> If his death brought vs from ſuch danger, what benefite wil this his life bring vnto vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt how many and how great dangers, ſhal it be able to defend vs? If when we were enimyes, we were reconciled vnto God, by the death of his ſonne, much more beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, we ſhall be ſaued by his life. For both the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath now more power and ſtrength to performe, and the matter is the fitter to be wrought vpon. Chriſt is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holie places, that are made with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true ſanctuary, but is entred into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauen, to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then we haue an high Prieſt, whiche is ouer the houſe of GOD, let vs draw neare him with a true heart, in aſſuraunce of faith, ſprinkling in our heartes from an euil conſcience, and waſhed in our bodyes with pure water, abhorring from our heartes this curſed and comfortleſſe

Chriſt, which <hi>H.N.</hi> hath brought out, not meaning to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte &amp; feede, but to pyne &amp; famiſh his familie withall.

                  <hi>&amp; the maieſtie of the Diuell himſelfe:</hi> they are his verie woordes in the fifteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his firſt exhortation. I will not ſtand long vpon this point, but content my ſelfe onely with two teſtimonies, and thoſe taken out of this, and the next chapter, whereby euery man may eaſily perceiue, what his iudgement is, both of the Preachers and people, whereſoeuer, or howe many ſoeuer that are not of his familie.

<pb facs="tcp:8542:86"/>
and they are not elſe what, but a neſt of Diuelles, and of all wicked Spirites. Therefore ſurely, the riches of the knowledge, in all falſe heartes, of the Scripture-learned, and in all preſumptuous or arrogant ſelfe wiſe is the falſe ſpirite of Antichriſt, which through his ſhew of outwarde holines, and great knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, worketh a ſecrete iniquitie, and eſteemeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as more worthie, then the loue and her ſeruice, and aboue the wiſedome of God, or the vpright life, to be the ſpirit of the ful wiſedom it ſelf.</hi>
                  </hi> And in the ſixteenth Chapter, which is the next following, and ſeuenteenth <hi>Section</hi> he confirmeth his iudgement in theſe woordes. <hi>Therefore it is aſſuredly al falſe, &amp; lies, ſeducing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, what the vngodly or vnilluminated men, out of the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or riches of their own knowledg, &amp; out of the learnednes, of the Scriptures bring foorth, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, preache, and teache.

<pb facs="tcp:8542:91"/>
life to come. And therefore our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, by theſe words of the couenant, proueth that the dead ſhal riſe againe, yea that</hi> Abraham, <hi>who had bene alreadie parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of riſing from ſinne in truth (the ſhadow whereof</hi> H.N. <hi>vrgeth, for the riſing againe of the fleſh) ſhould haue yet an other reſurrection: which is to riſe vp in fleſh and bone, to inherite euerlaſting comfort, as well in bodie, as in ſoule. For as the godly doe glorifie GOD here vpon earth, both in bodie and ſoule: ſo ſhall they likewiſe be glorified of him in both, in the life to come. And this is an article of our beliefe, and eſpeciall comfort left vnto Chriſtians. But how can it be that</hi> H.N. <hi>ſhould be priuie vnto theſe, &amp; ſuch like comfortes, who is vtterly ignoraunt of Chriſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The Apoſtle</hi> Paule, <hi>whoſe conuerſation was in heauen, and therefore already poſſeſſed of the riſing from ſinne: looked notwithſtanding for this reſurrection of the bodie, when it ſhould be chaunged, and made like vnto the glorious bodie of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>

                  <hi>as it is written in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the</hi> Philippians.

And beſide, in this ſhort abſtract of the principal points of our faith, is it poſſible to perſwade any man, that one and the ſame thing, ſhoulde bee the matter and argument of ſundrie articles?

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calleth it, a true light of men, according as we haue heard before in his title, that in reſpect of this doctrine, he chalengeth vnto him ſelfe, to bee called <hi>the true light of the perfect being:</hi> alledging the ſame place that here is cited for proofe thereof. But leaſt ſome might ſay, that this place is not plaine inough, to warrant this to be their opinion, let vs heare himſelf open his owne meaning more at large. Theſe are his owne wordes in the <hi>34.</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Euangelie, <hi>Section.</hi> 4. In this ſame day, or laſt time, (namely in the perfection of the workes of God, &amp; in his righteous iudgement) the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath now declared himſelf, &amp; his chriſt, together with al his ſaints to vs his elect, alſo made a dwelling with vs, &amp; brought euen ſo vnto vs, out of his holy being, the moſt holie

of his true tabernacle, with the fulnes of his garniſhing, and ſpiritual heauenly riches, to an euerlaſting faſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ieruſalem, and houſe for Gods dwelling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture: the which is the verie true vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbable kingdome, full of all godly power, ioy, and of all heauenly beautifulneſſe, wherin the land of the lord, with fulneſſe of eternall life, and louely ſweeteneſſe, is ſung from euerlaſting to euerlaſting, and wherein all mindes of pure heartes doe dwell liue, and walke with freedome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In this kingdom of H N. his loue is the fulneſſe of euerlaſting life.</note> 
                  <hi>and Chriſtian triumph in all loue.</hi> This day of loue is with him (as you heare) the laſt time, and therefore nowe doeth God make his dwelling with vs, and bringeth the fulneſſe of his ſpiritual riches. And this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (as he ſayeth here) is the verie true vndiſturbable kingdome, full of all godly ioy, and heauenly beautifulnes, wherein is the fulneſſe of eternall life. He calleth it the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, becauſe this doctrine muſt reigne on earth for euer: and therefore in his expoſition vpon this Article, he doeth not affirme, that anie one man ſhall liue in the ſame light euerlaſtingly: but ſpeaking indefinitely, ſayeth, <hi>the man ſhall liue in it euerlaſtingly:</hi> becauſe there ſhall bee from hencefoorth in all times hereafter, men founde that ſhall walke in perfecte obedience vnto this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. It appeareth likewiſe out of his <hi>Euangelie,</hi> that he profeſſeth euerlaſting life, to be nothing elſe, but his doctrine. So that to liue in perfect obedience vnto that, is no other thing, then to liue in the life euerlaſting, &amp; in that light that ſhineth therein. And it is therefore called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, becauſe it ſhalbe profeſſed for euer, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion preuaile againſt it. Theſe bee his owne woordes. <hi>Euangelie. 37.13. Therefore alſo is this day, or light of the loue with his ſeruice in the moſt holie, the laſt day, and the perfection or concluſion of all the workes of God, in the which God himſelfe, with his Chriſt, and with all the thouſandes of his Saintes, as in the moſte

holy of his true tabernacle, appeareth and commeth vnto the beleeuers, and obedient ones, to the requiring of his worde, to an eternall reſt of his holy ones, and to a godly conſolation for all afflicted hearts, which hope on God, and on his righteouſneſſe, and beare the loue of God and Chriſt in their hearts: to the end that they all, which loue God, and his Chriſt, mought now liue louely, and peaceably in the ſame reſt, with all the holy ones of God, and Chriſt, in all loue: which moſt holy the moſt pure perfect beautie, &amp; his vpright and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeruice of loue, we haue receiued or atteined vnto, now in this laſt time, wherin we inherite the fulneſſe of the life, to an euerlaſting ioy, with God and his Chriſt.<note place="margin">The ioyes of H.

Now he imagineth that his illuminate men haue profited ſo well in godlineſſe, that they ſinne no more. A doctrine, which the whole courſe of the Scripture doth vtterly ouerthrow. For the ſcope and drift of the worde of God, is, to leaue all fleſh indebted vnto the goodneſſe of God, that he who will glorie, may glorie in the Lorde.

                  <hi>In manie thinges</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames) we offende all.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt anie man, no not himſelfe, from ſinne and offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God in this his doctrine.

                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If we ſay that we haue no ſinne, wee deceiue our ſelues, and the trueth is not in vs.</hi> When the Apoſtles, and pillers of the Church of GOD, acknowledge themſelues to bee ſinners: hee cannot bee guided with that ſpirite, which did ſpeake in them: who ſhall denie him ſelfe and others to offende at all. They alledge for them,<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>is of the Deuill,</hi> To the which I anſwere, according to that principle which is begonne, and grounded vpon reaſon, which alſo our vſuall ſpeach and practiſe doeth continue: that the whole doeth beare the name, after that which is principall in the thing.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8542:93"/>
And therefore, when men haue dealinges in diuerſe trades, they alwayes beare the name after that which is principall. The Marchaunt who hath a houſe in the Countrey, and ſome dealinges in huſbandrie, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding called a Marchant, and not an huſbandman: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the chiefe and principall thing which he trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in, and whereby his eſpeciall maintenaunce doeth growe. The wine which is mingled with water, hath to name wine, and not water: becauſe wine is the principall and chiefe part. And that lumpe which hath great ſtore of droſſe, is named notwithſtanding of that golde, which is in it, howe little ſoeuer the quantitie thereof ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bee: becauſe it is principall in value and accompt. So that, whether we ſhall compare quantitie with quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or qualitie with qualitie, the principall ſhall alwayes beare away the name. And therefore no maruaile, if the Euangeliſt ſhall ſay, that he is of the Deuill who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſinne: becauſe here hee diſputeth not of one, or ſome fewe actions, that breake out of a man: but of that which is principall in a man. For hee draweth all men to theſe two heades: either to bee borne of GOD, or of the Deuill. According to this doctrine, doeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhort vs, ſaying: <hi>Let not ſinne raigne in your mortall bodies,</hi> for if ſinne bee principall, beare rule, and reigne in anie, (they giuing themſelues as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes thereunto) wee may lawfully ſay of ſuch with the Apoſtle, that they are of the Deuill: as contrariwiſe, when anie ſhall humble themſelues to thoſe dueties, which are ſette downe to vs in the worde of GOD, ſo as that courſe of life ſhall bee chiefe and principall in them, though in manie particular actions, they ſhall be found of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders: yet may they (all this notwithſtanding) be ſaid to be borne of GOD, and not to ſinne: becauſe it is not in them as ruler and principall, but as a ſlaue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and therefore not able to beare the name: When the
<pb facs="tcp:8542:94"/>
contention is, as nowe, for principalitie &amp; rule. According to this diſtinction, we do finde in the ſcriptures graces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vnto ſinners, when ſinne is in rule and gouernement: which are not denied, when it is in ſubiection and ſeruice. In the Goſpell after Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> it is thus written, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſinne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9.31.</note> when it is principal and gouerneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>We know that God heareth not ſinners.</hi> And in the Epiſtle it is plainly ſet downe concerning ſinne, when yet it is in vs, though not ruler ouer vs:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that if wee acknowledge our ſinnes, he is faithfull &amp; iuſt to forgiue vs our ſinnes.</hi> We doe find likewiſe in other places, becauſe of this diuerſitie, diuerſe and diſtinct things vttered touching ſinne. For in the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.8. 1. Iohn. 1.8.</note> it is there ſaid, <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſinne, is of the Deuil.</hi> And in the firſt Chapter of that Epiſtle, the Apoſtle affirmeth plainly of himſelfe, and of all the ſeruants of God, who liue here in this world, <hi>that if we ſay we haue no ſinne, we do deceiue our ſelues and trueth is not in vs.</hi> So diuerſe ſpeaches vttered in the Scripture of ſinne, muſt of neceſſitie force vs, according as the godly and learned of all times haue done before vs, thus to diſtinguiſh the ſame. For the further warrant of this doctrine, which giueth the name of the whole, vnto that which is not yet whole and perfect, becauſe of a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtudie, trauaile, profiting therein, and contending thervnto: conſider I pray you of that which is written by the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.2.15.</note> who when he had before confeſſed, that he had not attained vnto perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but did folow after it, ſpeaketh notwithſtanding immediately after of him ſelfe, as of one perfect: becauſe it was a chief &amp; principal ſtudie &amp; trauaile of his to grow toward it. <hi>Let vs therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reueale euen the ſame vnto you.</hi> And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde booke of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> (albeit the high places were not taken away out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

other thinges, whereof mention is made in the nexte Chapter: yet are theſe wordes vttered by the holy Ghoſt of him: <hi>The heart of Aſa was perfect all his dayes.</hi> We doe reade alſo, for further confirmation of this matter, in the ſeconde of the Chronicles: that <hi>Amazia</hi> and <hi>Oſias</hi> did vprightly in the ſight of the Lorde:<note place="margin">2.

Chron. 29.2.</note> did ſo offende in vſurping the Prieſt his office that he did ſmite him with the plague of Leproſie for the ſame: Which puniſhment was not remooued from him, vnto the day of his death.

                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 32.25.31.</note> that they did vprightly in the ſight of the Lorde?

And this rule which the holy Ghoſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, will leade vs to the right ſenſe, and meaning of all thoſe places, which heretofore haue bene alleaged, by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and are now afreſh renewed by <hi>H.N.</hi> and his familie, for this doctrine of perfection: a doctrine, whereof a man may truly ſay, that as there neuer hath bene any more pernicions, ſo was there neuer any oftener reuiued, and more eaſely receiued: for Adam his children would: ſtill be Gods, and haue their happines and perfection in themſelues.

It is euident therfore that in themſelues they were ſinners, in as muche as it is ſayde expreſſely of them that they confeſſed their owne ſinnes, aſwell as the ſinnes of the people. Whereby alſo that thirde ſhifte of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius:</hi> (That good men ſhoulde be called ſinners, onely for the condition of their nature, becauſe it is fraile: and not for any thing that is in their will, by inclining in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto euill) is not onely ſhaken, but vtterly ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for by their confeſſion it is playne, not onely that they had a brittle, and vnſtayed nature, but that they had yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in conſent to will, nay beyonde the will, euen vnto the deede, and doing of that, which was diſpleaſaunt in the ſight of God.

Now if the woorde be made ſo vncertayne, our faith which is grounded therevpon, can not be ſure: And if our fayth bee not ſure, howeſoeuer it it goe with vs, when the weather is calme, it can not be auoyded, but wee ſhall ſinke and ſuffer ſhipwracke, when the leaſt ſtorme of temptation ſhall beginne to blowe ouer our heades. And like as wee haue no ſtay for our ſelues, no more haue me any good weapon, wherwith either to beare of an aduerſary, or to make an aſſault againſt a deadly and ſworne enimie. For if the worde ſtande indifferent to ſuch diuerſe, and differing conſtructions, as muſt of neceſſitie be admitted, if Allegories be allowed: and our ſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no helpe from the writing, and letter, to decide more with one, then with an other: What will holde of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes

Whereſoeuer then Allegories ſhal happen to haue ſo good liking, and ſo great allowance, as <hi>H.

And therefore the meaning of ſuche as turne all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Allegories and borowed ſpeaches: is no other then to haue ſtrength and defence, to vpholde in religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, whatſoeuer any man his luſt and liking ſhall leaue hym vnto. As for the eſtate of theſe men, who in this their Allegorizing, are alwayes borowing conſtructions and meaninges: theyr dealinges are lyke to the traffique of ſuche as goe all vppon truſt: for be theyr ſhoppes neuer ſo well furniſhed of wares, yet all is but borowed: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they beare the countenance of men worth many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes: yet when their eſtate is truely tried, they are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worſe then nothing: for this long borowing, doeth bryng them in the ende to playne begging. And it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, theſe ſhall finde it to true (who turne all their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into Allegories, and borowed ſpeaches) when te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall trie them, they ſhall haue nothing to vpholde them: though in countenance and ſhew, they wilbe taken nowe for the beſt and richeſt among the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Where it is anſweared for them, that they receiue the woorde, heare, and reade it, alleage, and alowe it: true it is, they haue it, and as they haue it, Sathan both may and wyll very gladly ſpare it: For it is ſo diſguiſed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, that the true ſence, (and therefore the power and vertue that is in it) is plainely aboliſhed. So that Satan his gayne groweth too bee greater thereby, in as muche as the ſhadowe and ſhewe of liking, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging the woorde, keepeth many ſimple ſoules from any ſuſpition, to receiue hurt or harme by imbraſing of

theyr doctrine: whereas yf that ſhewe and colour were wantyng, and Chriſtian ielouſie had brought them once to a ſearching and examining of the matter: ſuche hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible hereſies coulde neuer long hyds them ſelues.

Nowe if vnto Allegories vſed in the ſcripture, it be denied to ſpeake as witneſſes for the deciding of doubtes, becauſe theyr ſpeache is ſo doubtfull and obſcure in it ſelfe: with what conſcience can the teſtimony be taken of <hi>H. N.</hi> his Allegories, to decide the chiefe pointes of religion withal, ſeeing they are all hatched at home of him ſelfe, and not one to be founde in the writinges of the holy Ghoſt? <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> likewiſe in his ſecond booke <hi>Aduerſus haereſes,</hi> and the tenth chapter, ſpeaking to the ſame purpoſe hath theſe woordes: <hi>Omnis autem quaeſtio, non per aliud quod quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, habet reſolutionem, nec ambiguitas per aliam ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem ſoluitur, apud eos qui ſenſum habent: aut aenigma per aliud magis aenigma: ſed ea quae ſunt talia, ex manifeſtis, &amp; conſonantibus, &amp; claris accipiunt abſolutiones. <hi>Matters called into queſtion can haue no reſolution by other thinges, that are likewiſe in queſtion, neyther can one obſcure thing be cleered (among them, that haue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgement or ſence) by an other that is darke: but of queſtions that be darke and obſcure, are wiſe men woont not otherwiſe to be reſolued, then by apparant and manifeſt proofes.</hi>
                  </hi> It is plaine therefore by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe ancient and learned fathers, that Allegories, which are <hi>H.

And he that bringeth no better matter then is an Allegorie, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of a doubt, is as he (who becauſe he wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth better witneſſe,) is glad to call a periured perſon to the booke: I except not in this ſpeach Allegories, that are read in the ſcripture: vnleſſe they be ſuche, as by plaine woordes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going before, or comming after, bee clearely opened, and made manifeſt vnto vs. The diſpoſitions of ſuch, as haue their ſence by circumſtance made certaine, and are founde in the ſcripture (I deny it not) may bee taken: but that is altogeather for the aſſurance that the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

doe make vnto vs, not for any certaine that is to bee had from them ſelues. They muſt be plaine and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſhal induce a man to geue credite vnto any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he is not already reſolued of.

I deny not, but that the <hi>Rhethoritians</hi> haue entertayned them, among their figures to moue and delight vs; when before the trueth of that thing is out of al doubt with vs. The Familie therefore are greatly abuſed of <hi>H.N.</hi> their Lorde and maiſter, whyle they are enforced of him, to take Allegories onely for theyr euidence: And yet are not Allegories ſo muche abuſed when they be admitted for proofe, as when they are made to ouerthrowe the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and hiſtorical ſence of the worde. For albeit the caſe be to bee pitied, when a man ſhall be, forced for lacke of credible perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s who haue beene preſent, to take a periured man to decide a doubt: yet is this more lamentable, when the party periured ſhalbe ſuffered, (to the end that he only may be heard) to ſtop the mouthes of men of good credite, who both could and woulde reſolue vs of the right.

Nowe yf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worde in his proper ſignification, be ſo much made of with Chriſt, &amp; the Apoſtles, as that it ſhalbe of ſufficient credit, to carry away a matter of greateſt weight: What wrong doeth <hi>H.

And becauſe the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> had aſcribed bleſſedneſſe to that man, to whom the Lorde imputeth not his ſinnes, and it was written, likewyſe that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his faith was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes: hee is not afrayde to ſet it downe as an aſſured trueth, that our iuſtification commeth by mercy and fauour, and not by merite and deſert, So that the naturall ſignification of the woorde, doeth carry away iuſtification from works, and geueth it by good right vnto fauour and grace. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this is alſo woorth the obſeruation, becauſe wee are about the force and credite of the naturall ſence and Hiſtorie of the woorde, that the Apoſtle layeth great weight vpon the circumſtance of time, which the Hiſtorie doeth yeelde vnto him: inſomuche that becauſe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was imputed vnto <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the worde of God, which is a rule of all righteouſneſſe vnto vs, the borowed ſpeaches which bee moſt obſcure, be taken from matters vſuall, and commonly falling out in the life &amp; affaires of men.

And touching the matter conteyned in thoſe parables and darke ſpeaches, hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to be no other, then that which is in plaine wordes deliuered, elſewhere in the Scripture: neither hath the holie Ghoſt any other meaning, in ſpeaking that darkely and in parables, which before was deliuered in plaine ſpeache (as hee ſaith) but to keepe contempt from the woorde, which through our corruption, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all plainneſſe and familiaritie caſteth vppon it: and that we might ſo bring a newe and freſh deſire and appetite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame thing, which in an other forme commeth (as it were) a newe and freſhe vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>H N.</hi> hee is farre from this lowe ſtile, that creepeth in the moſt difficult matters vpon the grounde: for when hee is the loweſt &amp; moſt neere vnto vs, he is at the leaſt ſoaring in the middle region of the ayre, and verie often a man ſhall not meete with him, no not if hee were rapte into the thirde heauen: ſo myſticall is his meaning.

And ſeeyng that hee fained that his doctrine is moſte perfect, more excellent and farre ſurpaſſing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, as which muſt be conſtrained to geue place vnto him: whatſoeuer the ſcripture witneſſeth of mans perfection in the commyng of Chriſt, al that hee ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently draweth vnto hym ſelfe and to his doctrine, that he promiſeth vnto him ſelf &amp; to his diſciples, the ful dominion of the whole world &amp; immortalitie, alſo perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea &amp; that in this fleſh, vnderſtanding by the name of perfect righteouſnes, that ſame inward affection of the minde, altogeather free from all ſence of ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:8542:107"/>But a certaine chiefe builder of the houſe and Citie of peace, and a framer of that ſame glaſſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, perceiuing that yet that ſame full libertie was not permitted vnto men by <hi>Dauid George,</hi> as he that yet bounde them vnto his perſon, boaſteth that hee hath found out a more perfect doctrine then that was of <hi>Dauids:</hi> To wit, that whoſoeuer dwelleth in the houſe of Loue, not onely is free from all religion of Chriſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo altogeather from all outward religion and from all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonies. Nowe he calleth loue that ſame affection of the minde, by which a man neyther feeleth in hym ſelfe nor in any other, any euyll or ſinne, but all thinges what ſoeuer they bee, hee interpreteth them to bee good. Now becauſe the neere kindred of the opinions of both theſe Antichriſtes, doe not onely bryng to nothyng the religious obſeruation of Eccleſiaſtical congregations, which come togeather in the name of Chriſt, but alſo taketh out of the mindes of men, the hope of the life to come in Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and doeth open windowes &amp; doores to al iniquities, I am conſtrayned to confute it in this place and that in fewe woordes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all I require of both of them, that they woulde playnely prooue by manyfeſt teſtimonies out of the holy Scripture, that the doctrine of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, muſt once bee aboliſhed out of the Churche, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more perfect ſucceede in the place thereof: and if it ought too bee aboliſhed, that it is theirs that ought to ſucceed it, &amp; to continue for euer. Beſides that let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme thoſe thinges in deede which the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifieth ſhoulde be perfourmed of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte in his comming to iudgement. And foraſmuch as they cannot bryng one title to prooue thoſe things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be amongſt men ſtarke mad, and deceiued with the enchauntment of falſe libertie <hi>(For none can lay anye

               <p>Now in that they obiect, that the holy Ghoſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.6.16.17. d. 26. et. 15 d. 26.

In vayne therefore vnder the pretence of the holy ghoſt, is any other doctrine then of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hoped for, ſeeing that it is the office of the holy Ghoſt to beare witneſſe of Chriſt, to glorifie him, to teache his woordes, and to declare thoſe thinges which he hath receiued of him.</p>
               <p>But if the aduerſaries wil yet further ſaie, that there is mention made in the Scripture of an imperfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doctrine, and an imperfect one to be deliuered to the Apoſtles, which at the length ſhoulde giue place to a more perfect: according to that:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>For we know in part &amp; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhalbe aboliſhed.</hi> Alſo: <hi>Nowe we ſee through a glaſſe darkly. &amp;c.</hi> We anſwere that the Apoſtle conferreth not the doctrine or Apoſtolicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. a. 2. 1.

And leaſt that any ſhoulde thinke that the apoſtle ſpake of any other time then of the laſt reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they write that they alſo ſhall come to the perfect knowledge &amp; ſight of God.

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. c. 9.10.8.12. Phil. 3. d. 21. 1. Iohn. 3. a. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>now I know in part, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhal know euen as I am knowen. Alſo, he ſhall change our bodies. We ſhal ſee him as he is, &amp;c.</hi> But if the Apoſtles had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that time, which our aduerſaries will haue, they had bereft themſelues of perfect knowledge. Our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therefore are deceiued, who after the manner of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, wil haue that time of perfection, to come before the ſeaſon, and woulde drawe it vnto this worlde. But this perfection of knowledge which Paul ſpeaketh of, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not by nature and of it ſelfe from that vnperfect doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and knowledge, but onely it differeth in manner, as well in enioying, as alſo in vnderſtanding it. For now we haue neede of ſundrie helpes, to atteine to the knowledge of God, and to this knowledge, may alwayes in this life ſome thing be added: but in the life to come, the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege which here is had of him out of his worde, ſhal not bee changed into any other, but ſhal be made perfect by a newe meanes, and ſhall bee had, by the onely beholding of God. Onely therefore the meanes of obtayning this knowledge ſhal be diuers and the reuealing more full: Becauſe God ſhalbe all in all. And that which the Apoſtle writeth to the Hebrues: <hi>Therefore leauing the doctrine of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. p. 28. Heb. 6. a. 1.2.</note>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8542:109"/>
Chriſt, a certayne perfect doctrine, in compariſon to the firſt principles of the Catechiſme. As are the profeſſion of amendement of life: of faith in God: the doctrine of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the laying on of hands: the article of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead: &amp; of the iudgement to come: which are as it were the chiefe principles of religion, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ought to be knowen and vnderſtood euen of children: when as al do not ſo perceiue the excellencie of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt. Therefore not vnfitly is it here called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Paule, which perfection hee leaueth not at all to bee declared afterwardes, muche leſſe too <hi>Dauid George</hi> or any others: but hee promiſeth that hee wil doe it, <hi>Heb. 6. a. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. a. 3.</note> which he moſt happily performeth in the Chapters following vnto the eleuenth.</p>
               <p>Now we haue proued that the doctrine of Chriſt is to remaine in the Church of God continually, as a doctrine which is moſt perfect, notwithſtanding that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the manner of reuealing and perfection of the ſame in the faithfull to be wrought in heauen, where Chriſt our lord ſhal make al his enimies ſubiect vnto him: and further more, that to be more vain then vanitie it ſelf, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries boaſt of the abſolute perfection of theyr doctrine.</p>
               <p>But if further they will yet continue to diſpute, that a more perfect doctrine then that of Chriſte, is to bee looked for, then I woulde haue them by euident tokens to prooue vnto me, that their doctrine is it,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.21.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> neyther any other againe to be looked for. For Dauid George hath boaſted that his was the moſt perfect doctrine, &amp; now that preacher of the houſe of loue ſucceeding him, reiecting that of Dauid, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth the ſame to his doctrine: and agayne another may alſo conceiue to him ſelfe the like dreame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee deſire that they woulde with as plaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes prooue their doctrine too bee the moſte perfect, as Chriſt our Lorde hath approued his. If neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will ſtill pretende that perfection, which wee looke for at the comming of Chriſt, then wee deſire, that
<pb facs="tcp:8542:110"/>
they woulde in very deede performe al thoſe things, which with vndoubted faith we looke for of Chriſt Ieſus, at his comming: To wit, that their bodies may bee glorious like the body of Chriſt: ſpiritual, celeſtial, not any longer ſubiect to the miſeries of hunger, thirſt, wearines, ſicknes, age, and death. That their women may beare and bring forth their children without griefe of wombe, that all vngodlines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away onely righteouſnes may raigne, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of bookes, admonitions, and ſuch like things, which are dayly vſed, they may obteine the full knowledge of heauenly thinges: and finally that they woulde reſtore all thinges loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> But as long as they performe not theſe &amp; ſuche like thinges, as aſſuredly they cannot, it plainly appeareth, that it is a mere beewitching of the minde, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an extreme madnes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſuch ſpirites.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very deere &amp; good freende, I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you ſo fully as I would in the matter you demanded of me, touching mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that ſort of men that name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the Family of loue: my tyme is abridged, and my buſineſſes are many, &amp; yet I muſt ſay ſomthing becauſe you did ſo frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly requeſt it. How much I may know of the opinions of that ſect, ſome can witnes with me, that haue been acquainted with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had with ſome of them and with the reading of a good part of their writings: But how much ſoeuer it bee, this may ſuffiſe to iuſtifie me before the godly &amp; men of vnderſtanding for my diſlyke of them &amp; their hereſie: that they diguyſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait tytle, making profeſſion of one thing in woord, &amp; another thing in trueth &amp; deede. They terme them ſelues the family of loue, but their meaning is that they bee more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Familie eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue it ſelf: for though they agre not alwayes &amp; in al places with themſelues, &amp; ſometyme they take this word loue, as is ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, for loue in deed, yet in other places they take it after the woordes of Iohn, where he ſaith: <hi>God is loue,</hi> ſo making themſelues, not the houſeholde of God, but god himſelfe. This they vouch in many places of their writings, in ſaying that they are deified, that is made and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gods, &amp; God is hominified, that is made man: not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the incarnacion of Chriſt, but as they expreſſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſaying, that Adam was al that God was, &amp; God al that Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was: which woords beſides that they contayne blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in them ſelues, ſo are they made couers to abuſe the ſimple: &amp; yet for al that, this may not bee their name whereby they wil be called, that is they wil not be called gods nor god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, nor loue, but only the Family of loue. Thinking by this
<pb facs="tcp:8542:111"/>
meanes ſooner to allure the ſimple, whereas otherwiſe if they ſhould in title themſelues Gods, &amp; deſire to be ſo called, they would cauſe al the worlde to abhorre and deteſt them, as they iuſtly deſerue. This name is but a new coate ſhapen of ſome bodging workman, that knew not how to take the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their bodie: their olde coate becommeth them better. They are in truth the Libertines, thoſe ancient looſe lyuers, for they lyue as they lyſt, no law of God or man to controll them, as men vnder no law, for they are men in deede, as they profeſſe (beleeue them if you wil) that cannot ſinne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the law they make none account, the Goſpel ſerueth them to as little purpoſe, they take ſcorne to aſke forgiuenes of ſinnes at Gods hands, yea they ſay, that whoſoeuer prayeth as Chriſt hath taught vs, argueth himſelfe of imperfection. Chriſt gaue that precept to his diſciples, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges before they had receiued the holy Ghoſt: &amp; after thoſe abundant graces receiued and as they expounde it, after that they were deified, it is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they euer prayed. And as their opinion is for prayer, ſo is the practiſe of their lyfe, they hold they may doe all things yea the groſſeſt ſinnes that wee make account of, and yet in doing &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting them they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſinne. How we may accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of them <hi>S. Iohn</hi> telleth vs, <hi>He that ſaith he hath no ſinne, is a lyer,</hi> if they went no further, they were lyers, but he that ſaith hee cannot ſinne what reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhal we make of him? This is their loue and their louely ſect. And while they ſtand thus affected for the ſecond table, is there any meruaile that they ſtand as euilly minded in the firſt? They cary lyke minds towards al religions whatſoeuer, the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Iewe,</hi> the <hi>Barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the <hi>Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as wel welcome to them as the profeſſors of the trueth of God: they ſay we haue marred al with making theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: were it not for theſe diuerſities of names whereby we maintaine diſſentions, their familie would be ſpred ouer the face of the whole earth. And ſurely I beleeue it, for if all men could be perſwaded that ſinne were no ſinne, if the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8542:111"/>
of God were remoued from their eyes &amp; hearts, if they coulde ſo baſely eſteeme of Chriſt and ſaluation wrought by him, as theſe men doe, if they could be perſwaded, that there were no neede of inuocation and exerciſe of godlynes, I doubt not but the whole worlde woulde quickly become a louely familie. I coulde neuer yet heare of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there was any exerciſe of religion amongſt theſe people: I coulde neuer heare of any due preaching of the worde, or receiuing of the Sacraments: how they ſpende their tymes in their priuate aſſemblies, it would be knowen. But this I am ſure that put licentiouſnes of ſinne a part, there is nothing taught or donne in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles, that might offend the horribleſt Heretike that euer was. Wherin they take a courſe fit for themſelues &amp; meete for their purpoſe, a man may bee a ſcholler amongeſt them xx. yeres before hee ſhall vnderſtand one principle of Religion: nay they will not drawe their doctrine into principles: ſaue only this that is their firſt and principall grounde, that who ſo wil be a follower of them muſt become a God, and he muſt loue. I might here enter into a ripping vp of their writings, &amp; of the manner they vſe in teaching, which is cleane contrary to the way that God hath taken to teach his ſeruantes &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being as darkſome &amp; voide of clearnes of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, as their profeſſion it ſelf is: Whereas the doctrine of chriſt is lightſome, &amp; ſo lightſom that it geueth light &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ſimple. But I muſt of neceſſitie forbeare to enter into this diſcourſe, becauſe my leaſure is ſo ſmal, I muſt for go to ſpeake of this thirde prophet of the worlde, ſent to preach foorth the newe Goſpel of the newe Kingdome. Moſes was one, and Chriſt the ſeconde, ſo confeſſed alſo the <hi>Turkes,</hi> but the thirde to them was <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the thirde to theſe is <hi>H. N.</hi> The firſt prophet that euer came into the worlde that had no name, whether of theſe two laſt Prophets is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I cannot ſtand now to diſcuſſe, only I wil ſay this ſhortly and in few wordes, that by many good coniecturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſons I could prooue that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the better:
<pb facs="tcp:8542:112"/>
But I wil let them go both: for this preſent, it may be god wil giue me ſome tyme, when I may with more leaſure ſet downe to you what I finde in their writinges and what thereafter I iudge of them. In the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pray to god, to open their eyes, that they may ſee their errour, and to keepe all other from going a ſtray after them, ſo forſaking their L. and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. To this true &amp; euerlaſting God who carefully watcheth and in great mercies ouer his children, I leaue you, whoſe holy ſpirit be alwayes with vs, to leade vs and keepe vs in al trueth.

<pb facs="tcp:8542:113"/>
declareth what it is that hee teacheth vs, to wit, <hi>To denye vngodlineſſe and worldly luſtes, and to liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, &amp; godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worlde, wayting for the glorious appearing of Ieſus Chriſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thirde, noteth what coſt and charges the Sonne of GOD Chriſte Ieſus our Lorde and Sauiour was at, to haue vs good Scholers, and to profite well in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and is contained in theſe words. <hi>Who gaue himſelf for vs, that hee might redeeme vs from al iniquitie, and purge vs to bee a peculiar people vnto him ſelfe, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good woorks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt parte, deſcribeth the order of this Shoole, and the manner of teaching and training vp of Scholers, in theſe wordes: <hi>Theſe thinges ſpeake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and rebuke with all authoritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this Teacher (to reſolue you in fewe wordes.) It is the Goſpell of GOD, whiche is the power of GOD vnto ſaluation, for ſo many as ſhall beleeue it: And therefore may well bee called the grace of GOD that bringeth ſaluation. The comparing of this verſe, with the nexte before, wil let you plainely ſee, that it can not otherwiſe bee ment, then of the woorde of ſaluation, the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſte: Which for iuſt cauſes, is commended vnto vs vnder this glorious title of the grace of GOD that bringeth ſaluation. It is the Goſpell then, that teacheth vs to deny vngodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither doeth it onely tell vs barely and nakedly what is to be doone, But with ſweete promiſes allureth, and with great perſwaſion and moſt louing councell and aduiſe, doeth exhorte and prouoke vs therevnto, crauing, beſeeching, and intreating vs to yeelde and conſent: not leauing out any thing, that is likely to further the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:8542:113"/>
that is in hand.</p>
            <p>The nature of man beeing (as it is) deſtrous of knowledge, howe can hee but bee welcome vnto vs, that profeſſeth to teache. If there were no more but the name of a Teacher, it were inough to driue vs to ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the good intertainment of him, Albeit we had neuer ſeene nor hearde the manne before. But when theſe Teachers bring giftes with them, the better to perſwade, and when thoſe become Teachers and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to whome for all our welfare and happy eſtate, wee are wholly beholden, may there aduiſe poſſibly (thinke you) bee neglected, and not eſteemed of any, who hath but the leaſt ſparke of humanitie or good diſpoſition in him? And beholde the grace of GOD that bringeth with it our ſaluation, teacheth and intreateth vs, to deny vngodlyneſſe, and worldly luſtes: and to liue ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in this preſent worlde.</p>
            <p>If you like Teachers, that perſwade and enter into the heartes of men by giftes, you can not miſlike him I am wel aſſured, that bringeth no leſſe gift then your ſaluation. If giftes doe commende, I thinke he is ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, and moſt true it is, that giftes and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, canne not but commende their Maiſters that bring them. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Prou. 21.14</note> 
               <hi>That a gift laid ſecretly and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the boſome of him that is offended with vs, is able to aſſwage anger when it is growen ſo ſtronge, that it may bee ſaide to haue ſinewes and bones.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 17.8.</note> Hee ſayth more and beſides this, <hi>That a rewarde is as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, it proſpereth and preuaileth, whetherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it turneth.</hi> Rewardes and giftes receiued, holde a man as captiue and Priſoner vnto the giuer, ſo that hee is ſcarce his owne manne, but ſeeth with an other mans eyes, and dealeth with an other mannes handes,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:114"/>
for he who commeth commended vnto vs by ſome rewarde and gifte, is able, as it were by ſome inchantment, to ſet what coulour he will vppon his matter, and that ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, as the wiſeſt man that is of vs all, ſhall not bewray it.<note place="margin">Deut. 16.16.</note> For doe we not reade in <hi>Deuteronomie, That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes blinde the eyes of the wiſe, and peruerte the woordes of the iuſt.</hi> And this is the cauſe, why in that ſame place, the Iudges are forbidden to take rewards, for ſuch is the corruption of man, that he will not ſtick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his euill cauſe, by thoſe meanes, if hee ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that the Iudge lyeth any whitte open on that parte. But this infirmitie of man, who oftentimes furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his euill cauſe by giftes, may not ſo preiudice the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſte, who is without all ſuſpecion to commende euill cauſes vnto vs, but that it ſhall be alwaies lawfull for him to vſe what way of perſwaſion as ſhall beſt like him: yea to enter vppon vs euen by giftes, and to cauſe the grace of God bringing with it our ſaluation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate vs to deny vngodlines, and worldly luſtes: to ſee if that which is ſo pearcing of it ſelfe, be able to touch vs: that which perſwadeth ſo greatly, be of force to preuaile with vs: that which often times ſpeedeth in euil matters: may finde fauour with vs to promote the beſt things. For what hath he not obtayned among men, that by giftes hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to perſwade. and among gifts, there is ſome diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, ſome be more able to moue vs, then others are: ſome perſwade more effectually then others doe: For thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, haue alwaies beene regarded aboue the reſt, that haue drawen vs out of ſome great daunger, or haue comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs in ſome great extremitie. the memorye of ſuch, is wont to be of greateſt continuance, &amp; of moſte thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance with vs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>The benefites are not lightly regarded, that are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in aduerſitie: For the preſent ſenſe and feeling of the miſery, doeth greatly enhaunce the price thereof: And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke away all occaſion of doubting, when he pawneth for aſſuraunce of his woorde, ſo great a matter, as was his thankefulneſſe for deliueraunce out of aduerſitie: For it coulde not be, that hee ſhoulde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to redeeme ſo great a gage. And in this higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of giftes, commeth this benefite commended vnto vs, for it is the grace of GOD that bringeth ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And bringing of ſaluation, prooueth our eſtate to haue beene damnable before. It is not only miſery then, that wee were plunged in before this benefite came, but a miſerie of miſeries: for wee were holden vnder the thraldome of death and damnation. Suche a benefite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth thankeful remembraunce, it ſpeedeth, where any perſwaſion will preuayle: Suche a gift, a man woulde thinke, ſhoulde finde fauour, and proſper whither ſo euer it turneth. Hauing ſucceeded ſo great and greeuous a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie: how can it, but haue the taſte of moſt bountifull and ſweete mercy? We may learne by this that hath beene ſaide, what the cauſe is, why the holy Ghoſt ſaith not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. The Goſpel teacheth and exhorteth vs: but ſaith the grace of GOD, which bringeth ſaluation, teacheth and exhorteth vs: for it is the Goſpell that hee meaneth, and yet he calleth it the grace of GOD that bringeth ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to make vs more mindefull of the matter. This maner of perſwading by giftes and benefites, vſed of the holy Ghoſte: may learne vs a profitable leſſon, howe to withſtande temptations vnto ſinne what ſo euer: to wit,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:115"/>
by keeping freſhe in memory, the ſeuerall benefites of GOD towardes vs, making them as Bulwarks, againſt our ſinfull aſſaultes, ſo that when they allure vs, we may thus aunſweare them, the GOD, who hath redeemed my ſoule from all aduerſitie, doeth forbid it mee: The grace of GOD to whome I owe my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doeth deny it vnto mee: the goodneſſe of that GOD, of whome I haue receiued life, health, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wealth, delieraunce out of theſe and theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, preſeruation from the murtherer, euill tongue, and ſlaunderer, doeth deſire mee, that for all the good wil that euer hee hath borne mee, I woulde not conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>If any Prince ſhoulde by ſpeciall pardon, deliuer a Subiecte from death, that by Lawe and Iuſtice had deſerued it, and after aduaunce him to ſome place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Lande: harde and vnthankfull were his heart, if thoſe ſutes eſpecially of the Prince, whiche broughte with them the remembraunce of this mercie for their better entertainment, ſhoulde nothing bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: and in very deede, the benefits receiued from our GOD, ſhoulde be notes of remembrance vnto vs, for his ſeuerall ſutes againſte ſinne, and ſhoulde bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at the Elbowe iogging of vs, to remember him, when ſinne woulde pull vs from him, And with theſe or ſuche like ſpeeches to ſounde in our eares: that Lorde that tooke thee off the Ladder, when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of euerlaſtinge death had paſſed againſt thee, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee nowe remember him: that GOD who hath picked thee out of ſo greate a multitude, that continewe in their infidelitie, hardneſſe of hearte and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and bleſſed thee with ſpeaciall knowledge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and confidence in him, nowe willeth thee not to forgette him.

            <p>The benefites of his maiſter towardes him, ſeeme ſo great a matter in his eyes, that hee woulde learne of that impudent and ſhameleſſe woman, if impudencie it ſelfe coulde happely finde out any colour of reaſon or excuſe, for ſo greate and grieuous an offence: <hi>Howe then</hi> (ſayth <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> after hee had recited the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his maiſter) <hi>can I poſsibly doe ſo greate wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe?</hi> not thinking otherwiſe, but that ſhameleſſenes it ſelfe, woulde bluſhe at ſuch vnkindneſſe, and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, as that was, and with ſhame inough begin to giue ouer, as one who had nothing more nowe to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, in ſo foule a matter. There is no man ſo baſe, but in reſpecte of ſome benefite receiued from GOD, hee ſpeaketh that ſometimes in his heart, which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth in woorde: to witte there is no man greater then I: but there are fewe that inferre therevppon, as <hi>Ioſephe</hi> did, howe then can I doe ſuch wickedneſſe againſt him,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:116"/>
that hath made me the greateſt. It were a godly aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage had of Pride, to make this gaine of our mounting and aſpiring thoughts, which would perſwade vs, that we be the greateſt: and thus to replie vpon them: If I be ſuch a one, howe then can I lie ſleeping in ſecuritie, ignorance of God, and his woorde, malice, and vnmercifulneſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſworne enemies to his Kingdome, that hath thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced me? You ſee by this that hath been ſaid, what is the vſe of God his benefites, euen to be the bane of vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and to ſmite thorowe this olde man of ours, this corrupt nature: directing the Speare of God his grace, euen to the heart roote of Sinne, when it ſtirreth within vs: So that ſinne ſhall no ſooner put out the heade, but we (calling to minde ſome one, or other, ſpeciall benefite of GOD) ſhall bee redie with that ſame weapon of his grace, to runne vpon it, and wound it at the heart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee what neceſſitie lieth vppon vs, (except we will exceede in all vnthankfulneſſe) to yeeld our ſelues obedient ſcholers vnto this Teacher: euen the grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſpoken thus much of the Schoolemaiſter, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der requireth to tell you what the leſſon is, which this good Scholemaiſter, would ſo gladly learne vs, and that is this: <hi>To denie vngodlineſſe and worldly luſtes, and to liue ſoberly, iuſtly, and godly, in this preſent worlde.</hi> Let vs ſee what this great grace requireth of vs, euen deniall of vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſtes. Thus doeth the ſpirite of God beginne with vs, for wee are ſo wretched and wicked matter, that we muſt be weeded ere anie thing may ſafely be ſowen or planted in vs. This monſterous contagion and Leproſie are wee admoniſhed of, in the order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, vſed by the holie Ghoſt, generally throughout the ſcripture. In the morrall law, almoſt all precepts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue: Thou ſhalt do no murder: Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie: Thou ſhalt not ſteale. &amp;c. to declare that the chief

goodneſſe of a Chriſtian, is to haue conquered moſt euill in himſelfe: and that man to be the beſt, that hath drained his corruption moſt: I meane, that hath driuen moſt corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of himſelfe, and holden his affections in moſt ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience. <hi>Dauid</hi> demaunding howe hee may doe good of a young man, ſetteth out his meaning in theſe woordes:<note place="margin">

for that is to tranſforme him, and to ſunder him from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his wiſedome being a part of himſelfe, and to make an Idoll of him. Yet is nothing ſo common, as to do thoſe dueties of ſeruice which perteine vnto him, or vnto our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, without conſulting or conferring with the worde. For to let the Papiſtes alone, who doe tranſubſtanciate the worde, both into a forraine tongue, and alſo into a ſtraunge ſenſe: Howe manie be there among vs, that goe into great matters at aduenture (as they ſay) euen led by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; ordinarie courſe of cuſtome, becauſe they haue been ſo accuſtomed,<note place="margin">Prou. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nowe when it commeth to paſſe, that we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly preſſed by the worde, to let goe anie pleaſure or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, that we haue long inioyed, who ſeeth not then, howe with full mouth we crie, depart from vs, wee will none of thy wayes? Then you ſee there is no remedie, but we muſt holde the Lorde faſt to vs in his woorde, for it hath beene alwayes the commendation of the godly, to haue walked with God. We are not ſaide to walke with God according to his infinit Maieſtie, and eſſence, neither yet in that ſenſe are we ſayde to depart from him, for his diuine being, doth not ſhewe it ſelfe vnto creatures, neither is he viſible vnto vs, but he hath drawne nie vnto vs in his worde, and wee muſt walke with him by that. For how ſhall we feare that corruption, that is ſo naturally ingraffed in vs, if his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doe not fray vs from it?

We are therefore to queſtion with the word of God: how fareth it with me in this deed? am I gone from my God? haue I in diſpleaſure taken my leaue of my Lord? haue I driuen my Sauiour farre out of my ſight? Can it be well with me, while my God turneth his backe on me? But when men liue without remorſe of conſcience, while they cannot abide once to looke vppon themſelues, in the glaſſe of God his word, while it is death for them, once to examine their doinges, doe they not ſay depart from vs, we will none of thy wayes? When <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> the Prophet in his <hi>8.</hi> Chapter, woulde note out the deſperate ſtate of the people in his time, hee ſetteth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marke vppon them but this:<note place="margin">Ierem. 8.</note> 
               <hi>There is no man that ſaith what haue I done: but euerie one turneth to their raſe, as the horſe ruſheth to the battaile.</hi> Then there is no way, vnleſſe we would ioyne with this deſperate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that we muſt ſtill holde God before vs in the light of his worde, and often come into his preſence, while wee take at ſundrie times the accountes of our doinges by the worde: accounting not onely with the worde of God, for the generall duties of Chriſtianitie,<note place="margin">Eſai. 30.1.2.</note> but alſo for the ſeuerall dueties, that our particular calling and place doth bind vs vnto.

               <hi>Who is the Almightie that we ſhoulde ſerue him?</hi> This is a ſeconde note of vngodlineſſe, an vſuall ſpeeche of vngodly hartes, howeſoeuer the tongue be cleare of it. For in deede they haue no inward acquaintance with him, neither doe they in trueth ſee any ſuch deſertes towardes them, why they ſhoulde be ſeruantes vnto him. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites they haue, they ſee them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with other, but as for any ſpecial regarde had of them, they doe not vnderſtande of it, and while they ſee nothing in God towarde them, but that is general vnto all, they aſcribe nothing vnto him, but a general kinde of goodneſſe, which they take to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly caſt downe among men: to be taken vp of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as wil. Beſides this, they neuer acquaint them with the ſight of their ſinnes, &amp; the deſert therof, which ſhould leade
<pb facs="tcp:8542:119"/>
them into a miſliking of themſelues, and let them ſee other wages then benefites, to bee by all equitie and right due vnto them. Thus it falleth out, that they would haue him ſhew, wherein he hath ſo bound them, as he might demaund ſo great things of them: as if they ſhould call for a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſee what is come in, ſeeing the charges ariſe ſo great, and the dueties layde vpon them, ſo manie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe. Thus while the vngodly receiue benefits, but not as tokens of fatherly affection, while in the vſe of the benefite, they are no whit confirmed in the peculial care &amp; affection, which hee beareth his elect, they cannot but ſay: <hi>Who is the Almightie that we ſhould ſerue him?</hi> What token haue wee of his ſpeciall good will, why wee ſhoulde in ſuch difficult matters ſerue him, and with ſuch daunger attende vppon him? For in verie deede, hee that ſhall gette out more then ordinarie ſeruice, had neede ſee more then common good will in him, who ſhall exact it. They enioy the benefite as other doe, but ſo, as they doe repoſe them in it, and returne no ſpeciall thing into the accountes of the benefactour, whereby they might knowe he maketh an other reckoning of them, then of the common ſort: euen ſuch as a louing father doeth of his owne ſonne.

Which thing if it were truely ſeene, could not but ſette a great price vpon thoſe benefites, that come in ouer ſuch deſertes. The minde of the giuer, commendeth not the gift with them, for they ſee not ſo farre: they ioyne them not as ſeales, to his letters of free grace, I meane, to the free graunt of his grace: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wee bee forewarned of this deuiding of them, and ſo ſtraightly charged to vnite them:<note place="margin">Deut. 8.17, 18.</note>

Can there be more vnkindeneſſe, then in ſo manie benefits beſtowed, to gaine no good will? ſo manie benefites to be let out, and no good will to come in with them againe? That wee may the more clearely ſee into his good will, and free mercie through his benefits, we muſt be brought back now &amp; then vnto our ſinnes, and the iuſt deſertes thereof.

by his benefites, as are no more confirmed by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in his fatherly affection towardes them: ſuch as get thereby no ſtrength of fayth: ſuch as doe not holde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the more bounde vnto him: as are not the more delighted in him: as are not the more deſirous to walke worthie of him: as finde not their heart the more ioyfull in him: as finde them no better minded to his lawe, to the which hee hath ſet ouer his owne loue: euen thoſe I ſaye, that dwell in the benefites, and ſo they haue their deſire, they holde that their heauen, and their happineſſe: that looke no further then the benefite, that ſtay vpon it, and inquire no further whether God doe loue them, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a father vnto them, ſo as they may account vpon his benefites, as giftes from a louing father: thoſe that thinke themſelues then to vſe his benefites beſt, when God and all goodneſſe is the furtheſt from their minde: thoſe that can finde no taſte in theſe temporall bleſſings, vnleſſe the mention of him who giueth the taſte and ſauour vnto them, be indented and conditioned withall, to depart farre from them, for that time which they haue to vſe them: thoſe that will neuer ſet their ſinnes in ſight, that they may further the account of the benefite, and the good will of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour. Wee muſt denie this vngodlineſſe, that yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, <hi>Who is the Lord that we ſhoulde ſerue him?</hi> after ſo long vſe of his benefites.</p>
            <p>Now would I know, where we might haue a place for them, that are leſſe acquainted with him, then they were manie yeares a goe, who haue leſſe comfort in his worde, leſſe Religion, leſſe obedience, leſſe good conuerſation: as for them that take his benefits, and with them doe warre againſt him, the place is taken vp alreadie in the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pit, if the Lord giue not great repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: therfore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for Gods cauſe, let vs haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our better acquaintance with him, who by benefits, hath ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended him ſelfe vnto vs, &amp; let it be our ſhame that he ſhould thus long

            <p>Now would I ſee where we might ſet them, if not in his ranck who haue ſo often been fetched vp from the loue of the world, by ſo many meſſengers of Gods mercie, and yet haue ſo litle ioy to be aboue, and ſo hungerly purſue the pleaſures and profites here belowe, as yf they had neuer (no not in meditation) had the ſight of any other delights. The benefites then leade vs vnto the Lorde, when in them we ſee him to be our father, and make the more haſt to come to him, hauing an eye to the endleſſe life he calleth vs vnto: Comming more in deſire from theſe things here belowe, and getting more holde, and more hope aboue: ſhewing aſwell in proſperitie as aduerſitie, that we are not wedded in our luſte and deſire, vnto worldly goodes, in wealth, by not being letted by it, to folowe the way that God doeth ſet before vs, nor yet to deale mercifully with our neighbours, and to walke humbly with them: And in affliction, by holding our ſelues well contented, in ſo much as we want not him, who is a plentifull portion, and the beſt heritage.</p>
            <p>The laſt note of vngodlineſſe is this, they ſay, what profite ſhall we haue if we call vppon him? Theſe are no ſpeaches of the tongue, as I haue ſaide before, but the
<pb facs="tcp:8542:121"/>
ſence of the hart. No man ſo euill that maketh not ſome reckoning of his prayers, howe ſome doe value them, wee can not be ignorant. The holy Ghoſt when he hath repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, for their outward worſhip in ſacrifices, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to call vpon the Lord in the day of trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that he wil heare them, &amp; they ſhal glorifie him:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 50</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king praier a ſpecial worſhip of God, &amp; ſetting it before the outward ſacrifices, in the <hi>4.</hi> of <hi>Deu.</hi> it is made the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prerogatiue of the people of God, becauſe there are none in ſuche a caſe as they be, who haue their Gods ſo nigh them, as our GOD is nigh vnto vs, in all that wee call vnto him for. Then muſt it needes be, that they are in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill taking, that ſee no fruite of their prayers: it being the ſpeciall bleſſing of the people of God, to haue him nigh in their praiers, by graunting their petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But foraſmuch as it is ſaide to be the voyce and affection of the hart, and no man being aſked, will geue out ſo ſlenderly of his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Let vs come to a further examination of it. The moſt ſort of men, haue no profite by their prayers, becauſe they make not conſcience to know &amp; do thoſe things, which the Lord by his word hath reuealed, to be pleaſing in his ſight: <hi>Whatſoeuer we aſke,</hi> (ſayth S. <hi>Iohn) we receiue of him becauſe we keepe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.22</note> 
               <hi>and doe thoſe things which are pleaſyng in his ſight.</hi> No maruaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yf thoſe be farre from hauing their prayers heard of the Lorde, who haue neither knowledge nor liking of his woorde. And a great ſort of others, who in profeſſion haue receiued his worde, when they want any thing, if they ſee meanes how to come by it, either pray not at all, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vſe the meanes: either els, if they pray, it is but of faſhion, as being in their iudgement ſure &amp; ſafe already: If they ſe no likelihoode to atteine it, being without hope, they let prayer fall. So if any thing fall out, where there was the worke of an ordinarie meane, it ſteppeth betwene God and his prayſe, and darkeneth the light of prayer:
<pb facs="tcp:8542:122"/>
If otherwiſe any thing come, where prayer for want of fayth was let downe that is put ouer to miracle or fortune: therefore in hart &amp; of experience they cannot ſay, that they are any whit beholding vnto theyr prayers. But wee learne in the booke of GOD, that the godly pray in matters moſte harde to be brought to paſſe, and moſt vnlikely in regard of any vſual and ordinarie meanes: and yet are heard, and geue him the praiſe. There are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>107.</hi> Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 107</note> diuers matters that ſeeme to be meere caſual, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming without al meanes, yet praied for, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; with praiſe returned to the geuer: &amp; vnder thoſe are al other alſo vnderſtoode, that may be thought to be as caſual. There is mention made of the Mariners in the Sea, toſſed with tempeſtes, nowe hoyſed vp, now plunged downe, tyll theyr heartes faile within them: yet when they pray vnto the Lord, they are hearde of him, &amp; then do they geue him thankes. Other caſuall thinges are mentioned, and al comprehended. But in the laſt verſe the holy Ghoſt, maketh it only the wiſe and godly mans worke, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande this, in trueth to comprehende it, and by true and inwarde aſſuraunce thereof to geue him the praiſe for it. The vngodly therefore in ordinarie thinges, are hindred by the meanes: inextraordinarie, they ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but chaunce: and therefore they ſay, <hi>What profite ſhall wee haue yf we pray?</hi> The children of GOD, knowe that nothing is pure vnto them, vnleſſe it be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with prayer:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Tim. 4</note> and therefore they reſorte to him in all their neceſſities by prayer. They poure their griefes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſome, with deſire to obtayne, that they might praiſe his mercies, and they ſurely finde, if they continue aſking, either deliueraunce, either els a tollerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which doeth aſſure them, that it is not in vaine to ſeeke the Lorde, and that the ende wilbe happy. Prayer for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, acknowledgeth God to be the geuer, and maketh prayſe to be geuen in trueth: Not to pray to GOD, is to
<pb facs="tcp:8542:122"/>
be an vtter enimie to his glory: not to pray particularly, as neceſſitie requireth, is to enuie him and his praiſe, and the practiſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> (in particular conſiderations ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his prayers and Pſalmes) doeth reproue it. The Papiſtes take Gods grace to be throwen downe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. And men not experienced of his goodnes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, muſt needes thinke, that hee hath put all thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a generall gouernment, for as for any particular expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of his goodwill towardes them, they haue it not. Wee muſt denie this vngodlineſſe, that groweth by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, into no experience of GOD his goodneſſe. Doe we thinke that any man, ſhall euer ſafely put him ſelfe ouer vnto the hope of the promiſes, at the houre of death: which all his life long, hee neuer tried to be true before? Wee muſt alſo deny worldly luſtes, and not only thoſe, which tende to hurt our neighbour, in body, goods, or good name: but euen thoſe that hold vs ſo in this worlde, as wee can get no true taſte in the pleaſures of an other: For wee are holden captiue of worldly luſtes, in one reſpect or other: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we become newe creatures, looking for that glory, which ſhall appeare at the comming of Chriſte. The next thing required, is to liue ſoberly. This ſobrietie, is a gift that moderateth the minde in his delightes &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and may therefore well be tearmed the moderatour of the minde. It is a gift, that doeth keepe the minde from pleaſures altogeather vnlawful: and in thoſe that bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it keepeth a man from the exceſſe and abuſe of them. That it is not onely reſtrained to the filthy deſires of the fleſhe, may be proued in the. <hi>12.</hi> to the <hi>Roma.</hi> Where the Apoſtle appointeth this gift and grace of God, to order euery man in his calling, That hee take not vppon him,<note place="margin">Rom. 12</note> but according to that meaſure which GOD hath geuen him. For in very deede, the minde of man hath many thinges, beſide the filthie deſires of the fleſhe, to ouerturne it, wherin this gift of GOD hath good vſe.
<pb facs="tcp:8542:123"/>
It was this gift that Paul had, when as he profeſſed him ſelfe to haue learned, to be riche, and to be poore: to haue ben inſtructed, to abounde, and alſo to want: to be content withall eſtates, and to holde him ſelfe happy in them, as in a portion ſent him from the Lord. In may be thought no great gifte, for a riche man to learne to be riche, yet doeth the Apoſtle ſay, it is a matter that requireth learning, and doeth aſcribe it vnto Chriſte his worke within him. It is therfore worth the labour, to enter into ſome farther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what he ſhould meane in this matter. The meaning he giueth in the ſame place,<note place="margin">Philip. 4</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith: <hi>I haue learned in what eſtate ſoeuer I am, therwith to be content.</hi> A leſſon neceſſarie for all men. A leſſon neceſſarie for riche men, to learne them to be riche, that is, to holde them ſelues contented, to remember they haue their boundes appointed them, and there to accquaint their affections to finde contentation, ſufficiencie, and a rich portion. So ſhal they truely be thankeful to God for it. For in very deede theſe hartes of ours muſt finde them in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwation richely prouided for, ere they ſhall in trueth and vnfaynedneſſe be ioyful in the Lorde. Let vs then learne from a contented minde to ſay vnto our hartes: This is thy lot appointed thee of the Lord, heere are thy boundes, this eſtate hath the Lorde diſtributed vnto thee, There is good cauſe, not only to be content, but alſo well appaide with it. We muſt learne our hartes to be content with it, nay to take it as riche and liberall portion whatſoeuer it be, and as a barre to holde in our affections from raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging into greedy deſires. For our affections are as gulfs, vnſatiable, that woulde neuer reſt with contentation in a-thing, but ſtill be enflamed with the deſire of more, which woulde ſtill drawe and hale vs forwarde, and ſo holde vs in continuall torment. The remedy whereof, the Lorde hath appointed our owne eſtate whatſoeuer to be: that it might appeaſe our affections, and ſettle them with reſt, peace
<pb facs="tcp:8542:123"/>
and good liking, as in the ſeate which our good God hath ſeene to be conuenient for vs, and therefore ſet vs in it, to finde eaſe, quiet, comfort, and contentment therein. For yf thy hart be not ſetled in thine eſtate, with good liking and contentation, as in a good prouiſion: it is vnpoſſible, that euer thou ſhouldeſt become thankfull for it. For to ſeeme to ioy without ioy, is to play the hypocrite, and to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. We muſte therefore take our ſelues to bee riche alredy, &amp; let goe this deſire to be riche, For as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that deſire to be riche,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6</note> 
               <hi>fall into ſnares and noyſome luſtes, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction, which while ſome haue luſted after, they haue erred from the faith.</hi> We muſt let goe the ſeeking greedily after that we haue founde alredy: for there is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſufficient treaſures in euery eſtate, which muſte be founde out of vs, to quenche this deſire to be riche. Let vs learne to be content with our eſtate, and to holde that as a certaine rule, for he that hath no ſure rule, ſhalbe ſo toſſed of his affections, and ſo carried hither and thither, as hee ſhall neuer finde a time to ſay, it behoueth me to holde my ſelfe heere within my boundes. Let euery man therefore with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> learne to be riche, &amp; to take vp good liking of his condition and eſtate, and take heede he conueye not the title of true thankefulneſſe from his God, while the vnquiet deſire of encreaſing his condition, ſtealeth all comfort, which muſt be matter of true thankfulneſſe, from his preſent eſtate. But wee muſt learne alſo with <hi>Paul</hi> to be poore, as well as to be rich, for hee had learned, and we muſt learne in what eſtate ſo euer we be, therewith to be contented. And this contentation of minde is a medicine for couetouſneſſe, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, ſaying:<note place="margin">Heb. 13</note> 
               <hi>Let your conuerſation be without couetouſneſſe, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente with that you haue.</hi> The riche man muſt be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be poore, euen to be redy with contentation of hart to goe vnder a poore eſtate, and to aſſure him ſelfe to finde
<pb facs="tcp:8542:124"/>
finde the Lords bleſſing and comfort in it. He muſt in his riches take out this leſſon, and ſchoole himſelfe herein, and by exerciſe and meditation acquaint his mynde to the liking of a lower eſtate, if the Lord ſhould ſo ſee it good: hopyng to fynde the Lorde very good to him in the ſame. Beholde a meditation in riches, and a leſſon that is of all men to be ſtudied, and not that onely, but learned alſo, and taken out: that if their eſtate ſhoulde yet be poorer, they ſhoulde perſwade them ſelues to finde the Lorde good vnto them, in that their condition, and therefore before to make their reckoning of a poorer eſtate, by muche meditation of it, and yet a riche bleſſing in that notwithſtandyng, euen a quiet and contented minde. And this would further the account of our preſent eſtate, when wee ſhoulde aſſure our ſelues, of a verye good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and plentifull, yf our eſtate were yet lower. Neither ought wee ſo to learne it, as a leſſon not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come to practice: but as one whoſe practice were not like to be deferred. This leſſon hath in it, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſarie vſe to trie vs by. For whatſoeuer he be, that cannot beare a lowe eſtate layde vppon him by the Lorde: yf hee haue an higher, he will abuſe that in like maner. For he that is aſhamed of pouertie, wyll be proud of wealth. He that is vnpatient when hee is humbled: wil be inſolent: when hee is exalted. For what can binde him to true duetie, yf it be not conſcience vnto GOD? whiche yf he dare diſpence withall in pouertie, he will not greatly regarde in aboundaunce. Thus wee ſee for a man to learne to be riche, it is expedient hee learne to be poore. For a man to learne to be honorable, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired he learne with patience and contentation, to goe vnder an eſtate without honour. This ſobrietie then, that keepeth the minde from beeyng ouercharged, and drunken with the deſire of a better eſtate: is principally &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8542:124"/>
cheefely required in a Chriſtian, yet reacheth it further, and conteineth within it thoſe, who albeit they bee not greatly ſeekyng after an other or better eſtate, yet bee they to muche wrapped and intangled, in the cares &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of that they alredie haue.</p>
            <p>This doeth the Apoſtle note vnto vs:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.29 30.31.</note> in the firſt to the <hi>Cor. This I ſay brethren, becauſe the time is ſhorte hereafter, that both they whiche haue wiues, be as though they haue none: &amp; they that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that reioyſe, as though they reioyced not: and they that buie, as though they poſſeſſed not: And they that vſe this world, as though they vſed it not: for the faſhion of the worlde goeth away.</hi> And he doeth not onely open the diſeaſe, but alſo giue vs the remedie of it: the conſideration of the ſhortneſſe of this life, and the ſpeedie paſſage thereof. Which he woulde haue to ſeaſon our ioy, to ſeaſon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, euen our bying and ſelling. As yf he ſhoulde ſay, there were in no place right ioy, right griefe, true bying, true ſelling, where the conſideration of the ſhortneſſe of this life, &amp; the hope of that other did not ſtep in, to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ioy, the griefe, the bying &amp; ſelling, the cares that doe accompany a married eſtate. Howe needefull it is that wee ſhoulde (euen in lawfull thinges) haue our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions temperate: The parable in the <hi>14.</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> doeth apparantlie declare.<note place="margin">Luke. 14.</note> Where they that are bid to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per make their excuſes, only by thoſe thinges that of them ſelues are lawefull and permitted. For it is lawfull to bye a farme, it is lawfull to prooue Oxen, it is lawful to marry &amp; to be married. Yet is it ſaide that rather the baſeſt of the people, ſhalbe compelled to enter in, then that theſe (who haue ben bid and are hindred by theſe thinges) (though in them ſelues not vnlawful) ſhoulde taſte of the ſupper. Wee ſee then how needeful this ſobrietie is, that
<pb facs="tcp:8542:125"/>
keepeth vs from ſurfettyng with theſe tranſitorie thinges. The very <hi>Ethnickes</hi> haue founde and taught that there is a bleſſing, which a good man may finde in euery eſtate. <hi>Scaenica</hi> hath theſe woordes:<note place="margin">Scaenica de tranquilitate vitae.</note>

And if this will not preuayle with vs, let vs call to minde the watchwoorde that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by our Sauiour Chriſte in the <hi>21.</hi> of <hi>Luke:</hi>

Therefore to conclude this matter of ſobrietie, let our lot giuen vs of the Lord, be our limitte, let a lower eſtate be well digeſted by meditation: let God his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be ſufficient, let his threatninges feare vs: let his promyſe (yf wee be weery) incourage vs.</p>
            <p>To liue righteouſly, is ſo to order our life, as euery man may haue his owne at our handes: for iuſtice is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that geueth to euery man his due.

He that is in the place of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement, is to remember, that he geue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his owne: For the fatherleſſe, in his good cauſe, hath the right of a father in him: The Widowe, of an huſbande: the blinde and ignorant man, that cannot diſcerne where the helpe of his cauſe lieth, hath the right and title of an eie in him: the oppreſſed of a Patron.

More and beſides this, the whole land hath title, to a defence and ſafetie by them from ſinn.

Nowe ſeeing by the expreſſe commaundement of GOD, there was ſuche care taken to purge the lande of murder, or manſlaughter, when the aucthour thereof was vnknowen: And that not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, then by ſacrifice, prayer, and ſolempne proteſtation before the Lorde, of their innocencie, either for doeyng it, or ſeeing it doone, they were diſcharged of the daunger thereof: What conſcience and care ought yee, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſit in iudgement, to haue, that you make not your ſelues, &amp; this lande guiltie of the blood, by winkyng at ſinne and wickedneſſe: eſpecially, by letting the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer that is manifeſt eſcape you? And if the whole lande, (where wickedneſſe committed againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Table, is winked at) be founde guiltie of blood: we ſtande in greater danger of that iniquity that directly concerneth the glory of GOD: I meane the offences doone againſt religion, and the true woorſhyppe of God. And the whole lande, is to looke for defence agaynſt ſo great daunger, at the Magiſtrate his hand. And becauſe it is a dutie they owe vnto vs, it ſtandeth them vppon to ſeeke the peace of their owne conſcience, in that callyng: which cannot be otherwiſe compaſſed, then in the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that: which is det and due on their behalfe. That which is recorded in the <hi>22.</hi> of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> doeth notably direct Magiſtrates, with what care and vigilancie,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 22.</note> they are too deale againſt corruption, in the worſhyp of GOD.

afterwarde they doe profeſſe, their meaning therein was verie good, and godly: but conſcience of duetie, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of plagues, where ſuch offences as there they feared, had eſcaped without puniſhment: made them iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ouer euerie occaſion, and afrayed of euery light ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as appeareth by the ſpeach, which they had to their brethren:<note place="margin">Ioſ. 22.17</note>

            <p>The Lawyer hee muſt deale iuſtly, and giue euery man his owne: for he is the liuing lande marke, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth men their inheritance, that pointeth out their right and title, howe farre it goeth, and ſo breaketh controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and telleth euery one in his doubtfull cauſe, where his clayme and title lieth, what lawe and equitie will beare him in, and where it wil forſake him. He (I ſay) is a liuing
<pb facs="tcp:8542:128"/>
lande marke, that by true opening of the lawes, boundeth euerie man, within the compaſſe of his owne title. And becauſe of that, doeth highly deſerue of the common wealth, as a moſt neceſſarie, and profitable member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Such men are the common treaſure houſe of the Land, where vnto the euidences of euerie man are committed: And they put in truſt withall, to reſerue for euery manne his title: that when hee is incombred for his right, they ſhoulde out of that Treaſure houſe, of the lawe, bring good euidence for him, and ſo forthwith, cleare his innocencie. The lawe is the houſe of euery man, where being toſſed with many ſtormes abroad, he findeth a place to hide his heade in, and beyng in ſafetie, doth boldely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne both winde and weather, quietly take his reſt. For being toſſed with iniuries, either in bodie, goods, or name, we haue no houſe of refuge, and reſt, beſide the lawe: no ſanctuarie in our vniuſt vexation, beſides that. The place which they ſerue God in, who are miniſters of the law, is verie high and honorable: the good they may doe, verie much, if God geue them conſcience and care of it. The hurt in like manner, is exceeding great, where the feare of God doeth not rule. For is it not a merueilous miſchiefe to remoue the land marke of any man? it is that ſinne, that had a ſolemne curſe, called for againſt it, by the miniſtery, of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> wherevnto all the people were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſay.<note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> Amen: And what diuerſitie or difference is there betweene him, that ſetteth in the land marke, and ſo boundeth a man ſhorter: and him, that either by wreſting of the lawe, or hiding the true meaning of it, is an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cutting ſhort, or empayring the true Title of anie man? Euerie man will graunt, that if a man of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, had the cuſtodie of all the Euidences of this lande, hee might doe muche miſchiefe, by canceling,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:128"/>
croſſing, interliuing, putting in and out, at his pleaſure, hiding, or ſhewing, renting, or reſeruing, as him luſteth. And is not this performed, while the lawe is made to ſpeake that, they knewe in trueth, it did neuer meane: and to burie that in ſcilence, which it was appointed to giue teſtimonie and witneſſe vnto? and if all this were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, what can be ſo miſerable, as when a man hath bene all the day abroade, in the ſtormes, and tempeſts, at night when he commeth home, hee ſhall finde his houſe in that caſe, that it can neither holde out winde nor rayne? And doe not manie who, are forced by reaſon of Stormes and Tempeſtes abroade, to take them to this their houſe and harborowe I meane the lawe: finde the tempeſt often as grieuous there, as before they did in the playne? woulde to God there were none turned out of their owne doores in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of the ſtorme, without any hope at all of harborow from thence? or if a man that had bene dogged, to his own doores, by theeues, and hauing gotten his houſe vpon his heade, beginneth to breath himſelfe, and reioyce, for his good eſcape, thinking all to be ſafe, and ſuſpecting no harme: who coulde ſufficiently bewayle him, if in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his Triumph, they bee founde in his owne houſe, that fall vpon him, and murther him? And is not the lawe, the houſe of the troubled, and vexed man? Yea, Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Hall is the poore mans houſe. And therefore doeth hee pay, taxe, and ſubſidies, that it might bee an houſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto him, able to keepe out winde and weather, how tempeſtious ſoeuer. If a man that is oppreſſed, and wronged abroade, in any parte of this lande, ſhall bring his matter vnto hearing at VVeſtminſter Hall, looke that yee bee good vnto him in his owne houſe, let him take no harme at home: His griefe is greate enough abroade. It hath alwayes, euen by the lawes of man, beene counted an haynous offence, to vexe and annoy
<pb facs="tcp:8542:129"/>
a man in his owne houſe.

Without ſobrietie and temperance, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; iuſt dealing cannot be holden vp, &amp; mainteined: for if a man haue not learned to be rich, &amp; to be poore, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hold out the courſe of iuſtice &amp; righteous dealing: when it lieth vpon the loſſe of fauour, eſtimation, credite, wealth, or countenance, to proceed in iuſtice and righteouſneſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:8542:130"/>
that ſtrengtheneth righteous dealing and iuſtice. For if we could be content to be humbled in the worlde, if God could not otherwiſe be ſerued, or a good conſcience mainteyned: we ſhould haue more power to do iuſtice, and to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in our calling whatſoeuer. But while men are ſo drowned in profites, pleaſures, and honours in the worlde, they are neuer put to any ſtrait, but iuſtice is ſtretched, that the olde compaſſe may be kept, and their eſtate vpholden. Let vs imbrace this temperance and ſoberneſſe, ſo ſhall we holde faſt this reine of iuſtice and vpright dealing in our places and callings. Many good lawes we haue made, to cauſe vs liue iuſtly one with another, but litle fruit of them: for why? the roote is not touched. VVe haue taken ſo large a meaſure of port and countenance, being voyde of this temperance, that the cloth muſt needs be cut out therafter.

For ſure, while the meaſure is ſo infinitely inlarged, the cloth muſt needes be ſet vppon the Tainters, and exceſſiuely ſtretched. It ſhall bee in vaine to make lawes agaynſt iniurious and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſes, if before, this great exceſſe and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie, that ruleth in all eſtates, bee not repreſſed. For if that in no caſe may bee abated, howe can it bee but that the olde ordinarie dealinges in righteouſneſſe and equitie, muſt bee racked? The great want of ſobrietie

that is euery where, ſpeaketh that there is much vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in this land, and ſo conſequently doeth plainly and euidently foretell vs, that the righteous God hath a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the inhabitants of this our Countrey, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe therof, which increaſeth in euerie kingdome as moderation and ſobrietie abateth. Now how ſobrietie decayeth, and intemperancie is dayly augmented, euen he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is moſt guiltie herein, wil not ſeeme to denie it. Wherby it is euident, that this land ſhall not be able anie long time, to beare the vnrighteouſneſſe therof. For this great intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie telleth vs, that the burthen of vnrighteouſneſſe which it beareth, is growne to ſuch greatneſſe, as cannot long be ſuſteyned, if our reformation herein be not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempted and taken in hande: which the Lorde in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie graunt, may be throughly thought vpon by you, who haue eſpeciall helpe in your handes to performe it.</p>
            <p>To liue righteouſly is the requeſt of our God: <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſaluation hath appeared, &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs to liue iuſtly.</hi> His graces offer themſelues to take vp their conſideration, in our righteous conuerſation, they craue that our vpright dealing may ſpeake, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde we haue them, howe wee thinke our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto them, they haue ſet ouer the pleaſuring of them, to vpright liuing, there they woulde haue it ſeene, howe they are valued, priſed, and eſteemed. Let vs then beholde a Chriſtian Meditation, for men of all callings and trades, when they deale in the woorke of their callings, to mooue them to equitie, conſcience, and regarde of thoſe with whome they deale: Beholde, my GOD calleth mee to witneſſe to the worlde, my thankefulneſſe for his benefites, he calleth me nowe forth, to value his deſeruings, nowe am I called to ſet my price vpon his mercies, and to leaue a recorde behind me, howe highly or baſely I eſteme of his goodnes: for the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence

of his kindneſſe hath he turned and ſet ouer, to be anſwered in obedience, and vpright dealing one with another: <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſaluation hath appeared, &amp; biddeth vs liue righteouſly.</hi> Now am I to ſignifie vnto the world, howe I think my ſelf indebted vnto God, for the benefite of redemption, for the benefite of his worde, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, health, for children, for friends, peace, welth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe are now crauing ſome conſideration. Were it not great cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that crauing ſo little, they ſhould neuertheleſſe be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? bringing all things, their conſideration ſhoulde be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Now therefore will I conſider of my God for this bleſſing, now will I anſwere in dutifull remembrance, for that benefit. And ſo draw forth his ſpecial mercies, to haue them ſeuerally conſidered, in our vpright life and iuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with men. Not with the Papiſtes, to ſeeme to requite him by merite: but with the godly Chriſtian, to ſhew him ſelfe not vnmindefull of them, in humble obedience to his will.

               <hi>and what is my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we ſhould bee able to offer willingly after this ſort? for all thinges come of thee and of thine owne hande, haue we giuen thee all this aboundance. That we haue prepared to build thee an houſe, is of thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and all is thine.</hi> This meditation will in like manner meete with our crooked and diſordered affections, in our dealinges, which are voyde of all conſideration of iuſtice, and mercie. While that we ſhall in this manner vrge and preſſe them: doeſt thou thus anſweare thy redemption? is here the price of thy ſanctification? doſt thou thus requite thy preſeruation? is this the thankfulneſſe for thy health? &amp; al thou maieſt find in thy hart to afford God for thy welth.</p>
            <p>It followeth, we muſt liue godly, this neceſſarily is ioyned to righteouſneſſe. For it were but a vaine thing to be preciſe in geuing man his right, &amp; then to withholde the Lord his, thorowe impietie.<note place="margin">Iob. 22.</note> Wee muſt communicate

with him, as I tolde you before in his worde: <hi>Receiue the lawe of his mouth, and lay vp his wordes in thy heart, Dauid</hi> hauing declared before howe the heauens doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glorie of God, and howe the creatures doe leade vs vnto ſome knowledge of him immediately as one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with the maieſtie and excellencie of that knowledge of God, which we haue by the worde, and as one who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that other kinde of teaching, to be nothing in reſpect of this: affirmeth that <hi>the lawe of the Lorde conuerteth the ſoule, that it giueth wiſedome to the ſimple, giueth light to the eyes, and bringeth ioy to the heart:</hi> making theſe to be the ſpecial prerogatiues, of the worde of GOD, which neither by the creatures, nor yet by anie other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes, may be atteined vnto, It behoueth vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to haue often vſe of the woorde of GOD, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take our knowledge from thence howe to ſerue him: but alſo to ſeeke for incouragement and quickening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto from it. For the woorde of God quickeneth vs to our dueties, and ſtirreth vp the ſlowneſſe, that by nature is in vs. A notable example whereof we haue in the <hi>2.</hi> of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chron. 15.</note> 
               <hi>cap. 15.</hi> Wee are likewiſe to reſt vpon his goodneſſe, whereof hee hath made vs ſuch large promiſes in his worde, to applie his benefites as ſpeciall helpes to ſtrengthen our fayth, in the perſwaſion of his fatherly affection towardes vs, and to prouoke our obedience the rather thereby, and to bee often and earneſt in prayer with him, both to haue our ſtrength and abilitie to ſerue him by that meanes increaſed: and alſo to prouide that neither by our ſubtile aduerſarie, nor yet by our owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wee bee intrapped in the nette of deſtruction. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit by his grace our ſpirite bee readie, yet haue wee a weake fleſhe, which is to bee dragged forward by ſtrength obteyned thorow prayer from our GOD. Theſe things muſt wee bee giuen vnto, and neither by a plaine reiecting of them, and erecting of our owne deuotion: neither yet by
<pb facs="tcp:8542:132"/>
a colde and careleſſe vſe of them, to tempt the Lorde, and to vpholde vs in vngodlineſſe, and the fruites thereof. The Papiſtes, Anabaptiſts, Libertines, and familie of Loue, are all ſworne enemies vnto godlineſſe, for as much as they will haue the woorde altogither ſubiect to their ſpirite. For they will haue it not to ſpeake, but as their ſpirit ſhall indite, and herevpon they build, that they are the Church: and therefore haue a promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, to keepe them that they erre not. Enquire of a Papiſt, from whence come their vnwritten verities, and manifolde traditions, they anſwere, there were many thinges that the Apoſtles then were not able to beare, which the holie ſpirite beeing nowe come hath taught them. The Anabaptiſts, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and houſe of Loue, vrged with the Scripture, will aſke you, what ſayeth the Spirite, affirming that to bee but the killing letter. Thus both of them, howſoeuer in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things greatly differing, haue this common principle for their foundation and beginning: that the Scriptures beeing but an ABC to Chriſtianitie, the ſpelling and reading thereof muſt be drawne from their Spirite, as if the Goſpel ſhould giue place to reuelations, and ſo carie with it the ſtaine of imperfection: or as if the Spirite could be diuorced from the written woorde, which it was ſent to teach and confirme. As it is written:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.26.</note> 
               <hi>He ſhal bring all thinges to your remembrance, which I haue tolde you.</hi> What can bee a more ſhamefull abaſing of Chriſt, then to make him but vſher, and their Spirite in place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him, chiefe Schoolemaiſter? that as the law brought vs by the hande to Chriſte: ſo Chriſt ſhoulde bee our guide vnto reuelation, and reſigne vnto it, as the lawe did vnto him. They will not denie the woorde, but in trueth, they make it a matter of nothing. For they will allowe no ſence vnto it, but ſuche as their Spirite ſhall ſette vppon it. So that in verie deede howe ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they woulde bee thought to leade vs to the woorde,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:133"/>
they doe leade their Diſciples, onely to the dreames and deuiſes of their owne heade. In the time of the Law when viſions and reuelations were often and vſuall, yet were they then ſubiect to the worde, and to be tried by it, nay to be ouerruled of it. According as we reade: <hi>If there ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>Howe can there bee anie true godlineſſe among this people, among whom God is not licenced to ſpeake in his worde what pleaſeth him, but the worde ſtrained by their ſpirite, to ſpeake after the liking of miſerable men? Great is the vngodlineſſe likewiſe of thoſe men, who hauing ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſuperſtition and fantaſticall reuelation: yet for all that, leaning vnto the holde of their profeſſion of the trueth, as vnto a ſufficient fortreſſe: doe not ſubmitte themſelues to anie often and earneſt vſe of the woorde and prayer, with conſcience and care to haue their wayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed by it, and with perſwaſion of anie great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie that they haue of it.</p>

The great thinges that are ſpoken of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> in accountinge the rebuke of Chriſte, to bee of more valewe then the treaſures of <hi>Aegypte,</hi> and his not fearing the furie of the Kinge, is onely imputed to this, that hee was as if he had ſeene him that is inuiſible.

It is worth the wayting for, there is cauſe why wee ſhould bee mooued to ſobrietie, hauing ſo greate thinges in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Wee beſeeche you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paule) that ye would walke woorthy of GOD,</hi>

The expectation of a tranſitorie kingdome, when it is but once deuoured and digeſted by hope, we
<pb facs="tcp:8542:135"/>
ſee it maketh men neglect liues, goodes, landes, friendes, children and countrie to hazard all. The Merchant that is in expectation of ſome great gaine, wee ſee into what vnknowen Countryes, into what daungers by the Seaes hee will commit himſelfe. The great regarde and care that is had euery where, to thinges heere belowe, the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die following after them, the carefull purſuing of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profites, and honours: doe plainely ſpeake, that the hope of an other life, is not yet ſetled in the heartes of a great number. Let vs call to remembraunce, howe that this is our day to waite, it is our time to ſerue: when Chriſte whiche is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall wee bee glorious and appeare with him in glory. There is no pleaſure which the Lorde hath not matched with ſome griefe and paine, to take off (if it might) our delight, and to faſten it in ſurer thinges. If the glory of God cannot preuaile with vs, if it cannot chaunge our taſte, how ſhal we looke for renewment? If ſo great hyre as is his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, cannot allure vs brutiſh &amp; ſenceleſſe muſt our nature needes bee. What a greater argument can we haue of our blockiſhneſſe, then that ſo greate thinges can get no more attendance. The trueth is, we are not perſwaded of the excellencie of them, and therefore in all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alledged for the wayting of his comming: there is the benefite ſet foorth with it, and the greatneſſe of it, which poynteth at our darkeneſſe and vnbeliefe heerein, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs that the glory of this world, ſtandeth as a cloude betweene it and our ſight. To conclude, let vs inlarge our hope, and by meditation and Prayer, enter into ſome conſideration of the length, breadth, and deapth of that glorye: ſo ſhall we ſee ſuch a portion in it, as will comforte vs euen in our greateſt afflictions, counting it a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that wee are vouchſafed his ſeruice, as the Apoſtles haue done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8542:136"/>Nowe wee are to conſider of that, which is the thirde thing in this our diuiſion: to wit, what was geuen to make vs good ſchollers in this his doctrine, &amp; to become a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zelouſly geuen vnto good woorkes. The gift is ſo great as himſelf, for he gaue himſelfe for vs. He laide not downe his life at the pleaſure of his aduerſaries, being otherwiſe vnwillinge, but franckly and freely of his owne accord did yelde it vp for vs. This is that which we eſteme aboue the benefite often times: the minde of the geuer. Great gifts are darkned, when they come from an vnwillinge mynde, and leeſe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation: but a willinge minde aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the leſt gift, that can be. <hi>No man taketh my life from me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>but I layd it downe of my ſelfe.</hi> His willingneſſe alſo appeareth in this, that he went foorth to meete them, aſkinge of them whom they ſought, and confeſſing him to be the man. As his aduerſaries did not compell him by violence to leaue his life,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> no more did good deſeruing on our part procure him thervnto: And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth herein note a ſpeciall thinge that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne with vs,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.10.</note> and prouoked vs vnto loue, and not wee hym. This loue was voluntary and not forced. It had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the preeminence of beginnyng and prouokinge: and was neither borne nor begotten, of any former benefite of ours to himward. In this gift that was geuen, we are to remember, not onely that moment of his paſſion, wherin he paſſed imediatly from life to death: but alſo the whole courſe of his life, while he had his aboade with vs here vpon earth. For he ſerued vs with his life, as wel as with his death: performing in it all that obedience, which the Lord requireth of man. And this obedience vnto the lawe, could not be vrged of duety vpon hym who was Lord of the law, in his owne name, and for himſelfe: but onely in reſpect of vs, whoſe cauſe and perſon hee was content to ſuſtaine. Touching his life, what a rare argument and token of good will was this to begin withall: that he would
<pb facs="tcp:8542:136"/>
be abaſed ſo farre for vs, as to lay downe the maieſtie &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wherein he was nothing inferiour to his father, and to take vpon him the eſtate and condition of a poore and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruant, to leaue the higheſt eſtate in heauen, and to goe vnder the baſeſt condition here vpon earth, to chaunge the higheſt dignitie, with the baſeſt condition, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt glorie with the greateſt infamie: the place that hath ſuperioritie ouer all, with that which is to ſerue all? what is the glorie of all kingdomes in the worlde, if they were ioyned together, to the glorie of Heauen? and yet howe impoſſible were it to intreate him, who is king of the leaſt Iſlande in the worlde, to chaunge his eſtate with a ſeruant, to leaue the glory of his kimgdome, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the eſtate of the meaneſt ſubiecte and ſeruant in the lande.</p>
            <p>VVhat ſubiect, howe friendly ſoeuer in former times he had beene to the Prince, could after long ſute preuaile thus much with him? and beholde the king of heauen and Lord of life, doth force this friendſhip vpon his enemies. It requireth our earneſt meditation of the matter, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatneſſe of the goodwil that lyeth vnder it: for it hath neuer before or ſince been heard off, that the ſonne his life, ſhould be the price to purchaſe vnto the ſeruant his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: that the ſonne ſhould be ſould to ſerue, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant (nay enemie) might be made free. Wonder at this worke thou earth, &amp; be amaſed at it ye heauens, for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, if al your regeſters were ſearched, the like ſhal not be heard of at any time to haue happened. The gift had beene exceeding great, if wee ſhould haue had no more at his hands, then is the ſeruice of his life, lead in all maner of obedience for our ſake heere vpon Earth: but after this obedience vnto the will of his father in all duetie accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, he himſelfe muſt paſſe thorow death, and ſo become a ſlaine ſacrifice for the ſinnes of his ſeruants. Wherin let vs a litle beholde the weight of ſuche a worke ſo ſhall wee
<pb facs="tcp:8542:137"/>
make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better account of him, who hath wrought it for vs. Let vs behold his behauiour, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time approched of his appearing before the iudgement ſeat of the righteous God for ſinners. Which although it be but the entera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into his paſſion and ſuffering, wil notwithſtanding let vs haue ſome ſight and taſt, wherby to diſcerne how hard a work he had in hand. When he was to enter the anſwearing of ſinne, he went, as appeareth in the Goſpel after Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place called <hi>Gethſemane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.36.</note> ſaying to his Diſciples. <hi>Sit ye heere, while I goe and pray yonder.</hi> While he was on the way, he began to waxe heauy, ſorowfull, and greeuouſly troubled. In ſo much that he (complaining of his grief vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peter</hi> and the two ſonnes of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> whome he tooke with him) ſaith vnto them: <hi>I feele my heart heauy vnto death, tary ye heere and watch with me.</hi> The paine preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo ſore, that hee craueth the eomfort of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in that combat. Yee may well conſider that it is no ſmall matter, which driueth the ſonne of God, to intreate his Diſciples to watch with him. But are they able to afforde him any helpe? In trueth they can giue no helpe vnto the mater he hath in hand. It is no great thing that is required, and yet for al that it cannot be obteyned. It is no great matter to looke on, though the matters which be in doing, were neuer ſo daungerous: and yet the Scripture doth tel vs, that the chiefe of the Apoſtles could not hold vp their heads, and helpe their maiſter at his deſire, while hee yet was but in the beginning of his conflict, with ſo much as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable countenance, no not after he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of their great vnkindneſſe, and expoſtulating the matter with them, had vſed theſe wordes towardes them: <hi>What coulde ye not watch with me one howre.</hi> A wonderfull matter, that <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bewray ſo great weakeneſſe, that beeing ſundry times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by his Maiſter, could not performe towarde our ſaluation ſo little a matter, as is the looking on. So farre
<pb facs="tcp:8542:137"/>
was hee from afording either countenannce or ſpeach of incouragement, in this cauſe. The Lorde had a ſpeciall purpoſe in it, and we are therfore to drawe ſpeciall inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this, that there did neuer greater want appeare, neither mo infirmities breake out of the Apoſtles, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worke of our ſaluation was in hand. For had they giuen but the leaſt helpe vnto that worke, howe ſhould men haue beene kept from matching them with Chriſt in the matter of mediation? For many be ſo mad, that notwithſtanding the beſt of them could not helpe with a comfortable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce; when our ſaluation was to bee procured: yet will they haue the meaneſt of them, at leaſt fellowes with Chriſt at halfe of the Mediatorſhip? for they will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that they muſt pray vnto them, and ſo haue them fellowes with Chriſt in the office of interceſſion. Howe hath the holie Ghoſt met with man his infirmitie heerin, and remoued all ſtumbling blockes, that wee might haue free paſſage to that alone Mediatour betweene God and man, the man Ieſus Chriſt? Who can deny but that the onely wiſe God did foreſee, what great folly and ſuſperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many would fall into with the Apoſtles and Saints of GOD? and therefore would haue the woorke of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ſo cleare and voyde of any helpe from the Apoſtles, that the chiefe of them could not bee kept from ſleeping at the beginning: neither from periurie and forſwearing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little farther proceeding in the ſame. For ſo farre wer they from healping our ſaluation forwarde, that beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to watch and ſolace their Maiſter with their ſight in his agonie: that they are daunted and lye like deade menne. And when they are wakened, and reprooued for that they woulde not watche one houre: by and by they fall faſte a ſleepe againe, ſo that no manner of comforte can bee had from them. And no maruell, for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie had determined, that the combate ſhould be ſingle,
<pb facs="tcp:8542:138"/>
perfourmed of one alone, and therefore it coulde not be, that Peter and Chriſte ſhould ſuffer togither. In deede there weare two theeues crucified with him, but there was no doubt (which thing the learned doe well note) that the ſacrifice for ſinne, ſhould haue any ſupply from their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The fourme of prayer which our Sauiour Chriſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto God the father, when hee entred into this agonie, doth likewiſe tel vs what paine &amp; anguiſh he did ſuſtaine. For ſundry times he made this peticion vnto God: <hi>O my father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> Let vs ceaſſe to meruel that the Apoſtles did beare no part in it, for this his praier doth declare, that Ieſus Chriſt had his hands full of it. Let vs not meruaile why the Apoſtles had no more luſt nor affection to deale in it: for Ieſus Chriſte him ſelfe, if he had followed the ſence and perſuaſion of his fleſhe, had flatly refuſed it, fainted at the firſte, and neuer haue gone thorowe with it: <hi>O my father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe.</hi> How heauy a waight of our ſinnes was vpon him, not onely, is bewrayed by his prayer: but alſo by the droppes of blood that fell from his face, and by his often paſſage, as a man greatly diſtreſſed and in ſore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: from his Apoſtles, to the place where he prayed, and from thence, to them againe. Somtimes waking them and ſeeking comfort from the ſight of them, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine intreating his father for fauour. Neither doth hee this once and away, but ſundry times doth he renewe it, and make often attemptes to haue eaſe by it. This was the beginning of this his conflict. Much anguiſh was in it as you haue heard, and little comforte comming from any, yet the farther he proceedeth, the more his paine increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and the leſſe comforte he feeleth. Before hee had the ſight of his Apoſtles, albeit they could not be kept waking for his comfort, now they all flee and forſake him, ſaue <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who did abide by it a while, but in the end did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare him. His father whome before hee did attempt to
<pb facs="tcp:8542:138"/>
intreat, now ſtandeth foorth taking the place of iuſtice, &amp; the ſeate of iudgement, &amp; ſummoneth al his ſeruauntes to appeare and anſweare for their ſinnes: Then the ſonne of man Ieſus Chriſt commeth foorth to the barre, &amp; appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the perſon of all ſinners, there ſtandeth he to receiue ſentence, &amp; afterwards executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordingly, which coulde be no ſlender puniſhment, for it muſte be a ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſinnes of all his ſeruauntes. It coulde be no litle blowe that hee did beare, for why it was ſuche a one, that the ſinnes of all his ſeruantes did dye of it. Howe coulde it be a litle ſtripe or ſtroke, that was the death of ſo many ſinnes? Nay vniuerſaly of all the ſinnes in his ſeruauntes? When he went vnder it, this ſpeache of his: <hi>[O GOD, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?]</hi> did ſufficiently teſtifie what waight and burden hee had of it. Before he was forſaken of men, and his deareſt Diſciples had leaft him: Now ſinne hath ſet his father againſt him, and hee feeleth him an vtter enemie vnto him. For that hee wreſtled not with an ordinarie and vſuall kinde of deathe, his words to his father doe bewray. He was to beare the puniſhment for ſinne, which muſte touche him, els howe ſhould we be perſwaded, that the puniſhment was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and meete for ſuche a matter. Beholde a true bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, wherein to waie ſinne, a Glaſſe that will geue vs the true ſight of ſinne. Looke vppon this glaſſe ye, which thinke that at your laſt houre, ye ſhalbe well enough able to driue away ſinne with a ſigh. Beholde this ſpectacle, yee that take ſinne in young men to be the grace of thoſe yeeres: and ſo ſlender a matter in olde men, that it cannot abide the leaſt breath, or ſight of one that hath gray heares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You ſee when ſinne is to be aunſweared, the Apoſtles left it, and Chriſte him ſelfe did ſundrie wayes declare, that he had enough of it. Wee may ſee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by this, that they neuer felt the ſting of it, who in their ſpeaches and remedies appointed to redreſſe it, doe
<pb facs="tcp:8542:139"/>
geue out ſo ſlenderly of it. There is one thing whereof we are eſpecially to be admoniſhed, that wee neuer make our ſelues giltie of ſo great vnduetifulnes againſt our god, as to cal his diuinitie into queſtion, becauſe he was hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled vnto this anguiſhe and paine in our perſon, and bewrayed ſuch ſence and feeling thereof in our nature. For how doe we anſweare the Lorde, if wee will let him haue no longer any honour from vs, for that he was ſo greatly humbled for v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? Hereby we may ſufficiently ſee and diſcerne, what a curſed and counterfayte Chriſte, that is, which <hi>H.N.</hi> hath brought into the worlde. For <hi>H.N.</hi> his Chriſte, was not firſt God, and then after when he was to ſuffer made man, but firſt man, and after by his ſuffering, was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with God. He gaue no ſpeciall argumentes of good will vnto vs by his paſſion and ſuffering: for him ſelfe had the greateſt benefite by it, inſomuche as that he coulde not haue beene ſaued without it. He is not this true Chriſte, who offered him ſelfe a ſufficient price, for all the ſinnes of his ſeruantes: for he leaueth euery one to anſweare for his owne ſinne, telling him that he him ſelfe and no other is to anſweare for it. And therefore looke what the ſinnes of. <hi>H N.</hi> his Chriſte coſt him, the ſame price muſte they pay for theirs, if they will beleeue him. All the helpe that they haue from him, is that he hath paide his money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo that nowe they ſhal not neede to trouble them ſelues, either about the price, to ſpende any long time in learning what is required: neither yet about the maner, to vnderſtande where and howe it is to be paide. If anye doe maruelle howe <hi>H. N.</hi> can make away this ſo plaine an hiſtorie, let them vnderſtande, that it is well knowen to thoſe, who bee any thing acquainted with him, that to ſinke any hiſtorie, <hi>H. N.</hi> will require no more, then one ſingle ſhot of an Allegorie. The Lorde graunt that they which thus aboliſhe the true Chriſte, and his office, to ſet
<pb facs="tcp:8542:139"/>
vp ſo curſed a creature in his place, may bee looked to in time: before they ſhal drawe others into the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Chriſte Ieſus gaue him ſelfe for vs, to purge vs, that we might be a peculiar people vnto him ſelfe, zelous of good woorkes. Heere are all the carnall Goſpellers condemned, who liue in hope, that vnder the countenaunce of their profeſſion, all libertie of life, will well enough be borne out: that make Chriſte his death to be nothing els, but a bande vnto their lewde lyfe. Heere may wee ſee that the Lorde hath not laide downe his life, to purchaſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing at our handes, beſide a profeſſion of the trueth: but that hee bought with his blood a zelous addicting of our ſelues to chriſtan conuerſation. It is a woonder to ſee howe the wicked will boaſt of the benefite of Chriſte his blood, howe mightie it is to merite, how ſufficient to ſaue from ſinne: But for all that will they not geue ouer anye libertie of life, that before they haue enioyed: whereas it was geuen to purchaſe a newe conuerſation, aſwell as a newe profeſſion. For hee gaue him ſelfe for vs, that wee might geue our ſelues vnto him, a peculiar people zelous of good woorkes. Let vs marke it then my brethren, that he gaue him ſelfe for vs, to haue the honour of a Chriſtian life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. He left his life for vs, that our life might be let out to honour him. He made not ſo ſlender a purchaſe with ſo great a price, as that if hee had a good ſigh, or a good word at our laſt breath, that would ſuffice him this life was geuen for the purchaſe of a zelous geuing of our liues to the works that pleaſe him. And therfore doth the Apoſtle tell vs that we are not our owne men, to frame our life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our owne liking, but are to ſerue the Lorde, both with our body and with our ſpirite, becauſe they are the Lords,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.</note> bought of him with a price. Yf we humble not our ſelues to a zelous folowing of good works, we w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>hold the lords due, for he hath paide a great price, to purchaſe a good life at
<pb facs="tcp:8542:140"/>
our handes. Hee hath with no ſmal price, but dearely bought of vs the honor of a life, led in zelous obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto his word. For we are not barely to geue ſome good words, either els to ſhew ſome good countenance toward religion and chriſtian conuerſation: but to haue our conuerſation de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare that we are affected with the ſame, &amp; become ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſuch an eſtate of life. Suche men declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be that peculier people, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord laide out his life.

Now where this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of his hath taken place, they are become a peculiar people zelous of good workes. If colde chriſtians haue ſo litle comfort from the death of Chriſt: what ſhal become of them, that are ſworne enimies, either to true religion, or els to good life, &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behauiour? It is ſaid here by the Apoſtle, <hi>that we muſt be purged, to become a peculiar people vnto our God, zelous of good works:</hi> which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of purging, the holy Ghoſt perfourmeth not by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but by meanes: wherein we haue great cauſe to be thankeful vnto God, that whereas our foode was exceding groſſe vnder the gouernment of the Pope, as hauing only for diet the inuentions of man: Nowe that pure and fine foode of the woorde of God, is not only made lawfull vnto vs, but alſo liberally layde out for vs. But herein againe, we ar bothe to confeſſe and acknowledge our want, that ſeing we are not voyde of ſinne, while we remayne in this fleſh, and therfore haue neede to be often purged &amp; clenſed: our purgations (for all this ſo greate a change &amp; ſo good a conſtitution of the minde vnder the Goſpell) be nowe at this day nothing diuers from thoſe, that were vſed in that

that greate groſſenes which we had vnder the Pope. The Cannon lawe I confeſſe might purge ſomewhat in thoſe times of ignorance, when becauſe the foode was ſo groſſe, the minde coulde not but be full of great and grieuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores: but now the conſtitution of our mindes beyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, by reaſon that the foode is ſo cleane diuers from that it hath benne, how can it purge to any purpoſe? Let vs therfore euery one pray, that ſeing by reaſon of this good diet of the Goſpell, the ſtate and conſtitution of our minde is chaunged: in ſteede of the Cannon lawe, which paſſeth ouer many daungerous humors, and purgeth them neuer a whit, by reaſon of the great groſſneſſe that is in it: VVe may haue rules &amp; Canons out of the worde of God, which will pearce further, &amp; purge other humoures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue great ſtore, &amp; thoſe ſuch, as do greatly blemiſhe the Goſpell, and cauſeth ſo greate ſlaunder vnto our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as hyndreth many from comyng thervnto.

Or what old ones be once repelid, how vnprofitable or hurtfull ſo euer expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth tel vs that they be? The Lord touch them with the care of it, who haue eſpecial authoritie to redreſſe it. I haue already bene verie long, and the weather hath bene very tedious vnto you, a woorde therefore or two of the laſt point, and ſo I make an ende.</p>
            <p>The maner of teaching, &amp; trayning of ſchollers in Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:8542:141"/>
his ſchoole, is by teaching, exhorting, and rebuking theſe thinges, ſaieth the Apoſtle: <hi>Speake, exhort, and rebuke with all authoritie.</hi> We cannot conceaue the matters of ſaluation, by and of our ſelues, they muſt be taught vs, and when wee yeelde vnto them in iudgement, beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth thereof: it is another labour then the former, to be rightly affected with them. And therfore they muſt be preſſed vpon our affections by exhorting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking, for we are not by and by truely touched with our dutie, and humbled to the obedience thereof, when once wee haue ſubſcribed in our iudgement, to the truth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the thing. Men muſte haue ſpeciall cunning and ſkill from God, that ſhall come within vs, and make vs in iudgement and affection, to yeelde vnto duetie: howe ſhall they preach ſaith the Apoſtle, vnleſſe they be ſent? This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a ſtrong and a woonderful corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be within vs, which hath ſo blinded our reaſon, and hardened our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they muſt bee men of ſpeciall giftes and graces, that ſhalbe able to open the eyes of our mind, to conceiue the trueth, and to touche our affections ſo, as they ſhalbe moued to make conſcience of the ſame. We may well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne then howe vnprofitable thoſe miniſters bee in their place, who know nothing how to exhort and rebuke. Who woulde hyre into his harueſt a Mower, that coulde not ſet an edge vpon his ſith, when it ſhould happen to be blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſtones, or other thinges, that were hid in the graſſe? And is not teaching, exhorting, and rebuking, the edge of the worde, which maketh it cut? And be not our heartes of themſelues, if Sathan ſhoulde caſt in no outwarde occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a grounde that is full of ſtones? and what ſhoulde hee doe then in the harueſt of the Lorde, that cannot geue an edge to the worde, by ſtrengthening the trueth of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, if falſe Prophets and Teachers ſhould caſt in ſtones of hereſie, &amp; erronious opinions: nor yet by waking and rowſing the affections of men, by exhorting, and rebuking
<pb facs="tcp:8542:141"/>
acording to ſound doctrine, when Sathan ſhall (as he day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth) caſt in great and mightie ſtones of ſecuritie, and hardnes of heart? Nowe the Scripture hath plainely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde vs, that in theſe latter Dayes eſpecially, the Lorde his fielde ſhalbe full of ſuche ſtones. It is a matter, that ought to gette both feares and prayers from vs, euen in the behalfe of the Lord, as wel as in reſpect of our ſelues: to ſee ſo many vnmeete men in our countrey, carie ſithes into the Lordes harueſt, who when once they meete with any ſtoppe, and bee ſet but a little beſide their booke, muſt bee forced to returne home with their ſithes vppon their ſhoulders, and let the Lordes medowe continue, vntill it ſhalbe withered, or eaten vp of the aduerſarie.</p>
            <p>The Lorde geue them heartes to thinke of it: whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour although it were but a little, might doe greate good for the reformation thereof. And as the Churche hath a great plague of theſe men, ſo hath it of another ſort, who haue giftes, and are well able to teache, and to exhort, but yet for all that they will not abide and bee reſident vppon their flockes, to diſcharge that duetie in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but careleſſely committe them ouer vnto others. An offence that in the greateſt darkeneſſe of Poperie, hath bene founde faulte withall among themſelues, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to haue beene the onely decay of their kingdome. And therefore a pitifull thing yt is, that in this light of the Goſpel, it ſhould not be acknowledged, that there is great ſinne in ſuche thinges.<note place="margin">Eſpenſaeus in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheum.</note> 
               <hi>Eſpenſaeus</hi> a Popiſhe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, affirmeth that a famous Preacher of his time, did oftentimes thunder out agaynſt thoſe men, that ſo careleſſely ſet ouer their charges vnto others: tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them plainely, that the Lorde woulde ſerue them in the world to come, according as they did ſerue him here: <hi>Adibunt per Vicarios paradiſum, in perſona, inferos.</hi> The Lord (ſaith he) will ſend ſuch men to heauen, by Vicares,

and to hell, in their owne perſons. He confeſſeth that the Preacher, did openly denounce ſuch iudgementes againſt them: <hi>Solitus eſt palam illis polliceri vicariam ſalutem, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalem verò perniciem.</hi> Others ſhal go to heauen for them (ſaith he) for as for themſelues in their owne perſon, they muſt be of neceſſitie reſident, vpon a perſonage of theirs in Hell, which is called perdition. The ſpeache as he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is ouer pleaſant, for ſo weightie &amp; graue a matter, as alſo for ſo heauy and harde iudgement. God graunt that ſo pleaſant ſpeache, may finde gentle and courteous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, with ſo many as ſhalbe founde faultie herein. VVell ſo great is the corruption of oure nature, that wee haue neede of diligent teaching, exhorting and rebuking, if we ſhall yeelde any glorie vnto our god, or good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to our brethren. To conclude therfore, (for I haue ſtoode long, and am afraid, haue weried you as wel as my ſelfe.) The Lord of all Maieſtie &amp; power graunt, that as Chriſt Ieſus, when he came into the worlde, founde the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of <hi>Iurie</hi> carefully looking to their flockes: ſo when he ſhal come againe to iudgement, he may finde thoſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, who haue his Church, and choſen people for their flocke, ſo diligently watching and faithfully attending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſame: as that by the meanes thereof, he may haue great glorie from his people, by plentifull fruites of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, righteouſneſſe, and ſobrietie: and that the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all places thus glorified, our conſciences may bee truely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted in Chriſt Ieſus, To whom with the father and the holy Ghoſt, one true and euerliuing God, bee al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory, &amp; dominion, both nowe &amp; euer. Amen.</p>
